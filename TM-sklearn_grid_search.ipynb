      "['Matrix rank based ontology matching: An extension of string equality matchingIn this article, a string-based algorithm and the analogy of the total number of deviations that exist between two matrices are used for ontology matching. The type of matching and the distance between them are derived from the rank of the matrix. This process is useful for an agent programme to extract the knowledge from the application domain and to evaluate the result of matching to decide whether to include or exclude the ontology. As a case study to demonstrate the developed algorithm, the Fast Breeder Test Reactor (FBTR) is taken for analysis by representing its components, such as the steam generator system and the control rod drive mechanism, in formats such as RDF (Resource Description Framework) and OWL (Web Ontology Language).'\n",

Oriented AZO thin films were grown using DC magnetron sputtering by varying Ar gas flow rates. The influence of Ar flow rate on the structural, electrical and optical properties of AZO thin films suitable for transparent conducting oxide (TCO) and back reflector applications was investigated. The (a-Si:H) solar cells, with and without AZO back reflector, were fabricated on FTO coated glass substrates using the PECVD technique. The solar cells were tested using a Sun simulator under AM 1.5 condition. Enhancement in current density from 12.46 to 14.24 mA/cm2 with the AZO back reflector was observed, thereby increasing the efficiency of the solar cell from 6.38 to 7.82 %, respectively.'\n",
      " 'Assessment of natural radioactivity and radiological hazards in building materials used in the Tiruvannamalai District, Tamilnadu, India, using a statistical approachOne-hundred-fifty-one samples of six types of building materials were collected from different locations of the Tiruvannamalai District, Tamilnadu, and were analyzed using a gamma ray spectroscopy system. From the results, the highest values observed in the specific activities of 226Ra, 232Th and 40K were 116.1 (soil) 106.67 (sand) and 527.533 (tiles) in Bq kg−1, while the lowest values observed in the specific activities of the same radionuclides were 35.73, 37.75 and 159.83 for cement in Bq kg−1, respectively. The potential radiological hazards were assessed by calculating the radium equivalent activity (Raeq), the indoor absorbed gamma dose rate (DR), the annual effective dose rate (HR), the activity utilization index (I), the alpha index (Iα), the gamma index (Iγ), and the external hazard (Hex) and internal hazard (Hin) indices. The estimated mean value of the absorbed dose rate of 148.35 nGy h−1 is slightly higher than the world average value of 84 nGy h−1, and the annual effective dose in the studied samples is 0.1824 mSv y−1, which is lower than the recommended limit. Multivariate statistical methods are applied to determine the existing relationship between radionuclides and radiological health hazard parameters and to identify the maximum contribution of radionuclide in radioactivity. The values of the hazard indices were below the recommended levels; therefore, it is concluded that the buildings constructed from such materials are safe for the inhabitants. The findings from this research will be useful to assess the radiation hazards of building materials in humans.'\n",

      " 'Comparison of phase interaction models for high pressure subcooled boiling flow in long vertical tubesIn this article, Eulerian two fluid model is used for prediction of high pressure subcooled nucleate flow boiling in vertical tubes. Predictions of different turbulence models, phase interaction models have been compared with previous experimental data. Axial and radial profiles of vapor fraction and liquid temperature have been used for comparison of these models. Bubble departure diameter models and bubble induced turbulence models show the significant effect on the vapor fraction prediction. It was found that use of Kocamustafaogullari and Ishii models for bubble departure diameter and nucleation site density are suitable for predicting vapor distribution and liquid temperature for high pressure boiling. Models of interfacial heat transfer and bubble departure frequency developed for low pressure or atmospheric conditions showed a good applicability for high pressure conditions also. Inclusion of wall lubrication force showed the void fraction peak near the wall. Simulated pressure drop predictions for high pressure flow boiling in a 13 m long vertical tube shows the error of 2-10% with experimental data. This indicates that computational fluid dynamics (CFD) is the promising technique for pressure drop prediction. '\n",
      " 'Numerical simulation of Post Accident Heat Removal in a typical pool-type SFR under severe core relocation scenarioUnder a hypothetical core meltdown and relocation scenario in Sodium cooled Fast Reactor (SFR), there may be a chance for reactor main vessel failure if the core debris are allowed to settle at the bottom of this vessel. To avoid this, an in-vessel core catcher assembly is installed in pool type SFRs just above the bottom wall of the main vessel. The function of this assembly is to collect, retain and passively cool the core debris by assisting natural convection decay heat removal from these debris. In this work, the passive decay heat removal from the core debris settled on single-tray-type design of core catcher has been numerically simulated under different amounts of core relocation using a validated 2-D axisymmetric CFD model. The maximum temperature experienced by the debris bed, core catcher plate and the welded joint between the core support structure and the main vessel (i.e., triple point) are evaluated in order to estimate the amount of core relocation that can be safely handled by the primary containment system under Post Accident Heat Removal (PAHR) scenario. The numerical study revealed that the single-tray-type design of core catcher can potentially assist the passive cooling even under the settling of debris material with heat generation equivalent to 60% of the full core on the core catcher. In addition to this, the effect of the size of opening created on grid plate during core relocation on Post Accident Heat Removal (PAHR) is studied for different amounts of core relocation. From this numerical study, the thermal capability of single-tray type in-vessel core catcher of SFR is assessed. The predictions are useful in determining the safe thermal margins available under core relocation scenarios and extending the functionality of single-tray-type core catcher for handling Whole Core Meltdown Accident (WCA) scenario in future SFRs. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd'\n",
      " 'Transport phenomena in the electrodeionization of cesium from AMP-PANElectrodeionization (EDI) of cesium from cesium-sorbed ammonium molybdophosphate-polyacrylonitrile (AMP-PAN) was investigated by passing eluant through the packed bed of ion-exchange resin in an electrodialysis cell. The deionized cesium from the packed bed was recovered in catholyte by migration and in the eluant by convection. Recovery percentage of Cs by migration increased while the recovery by convection decreased with increase in current density from 20 to 40 mA/cm2. Increased eluant concentration resulted in low migration percentage of cesium. Increased catholyte concentration had a negligible effect on total recovery. Apparent diffusion coefficients evaluated using the Nernst–Plank relation increased with increase in current density and catholyte concentration while a decreasing trend was observed with increase in eluant concentration. © 2017 Taylor and Francis.'\n",

      " 'Alternative method for determination of specific activity of plutonium present in the irradiated fuel solutionThis paper describes a simple analytical technique for determining the specific activity of plutonium (Pu) present in the irradiated fuel solution without having the knowledge of isotopic composition. The Pu of unknown isotopic composition present in the irradiated fuel solution of spent fuel discharged from nuclear reactor was quantitatively oxidized to Pu (VI) with Ce (IV) in the nitric acid medium and the optical density was measured at a wavelength of 830 nm subsequently. The gross alpha activity of the Pu in the sample was determined after purification from fission products and minor actinides by solvent-extraction method. A spectrophotometric measurement of different samples with known concentration of Pu (VI) free from fission products and minor actinides was performed for obtaining the molar extinction coefficient. The experimental data such as optical density, molar extinction coefficient and gross alpha activity were employed to calculate the alpha specific activity of Pu of un-known isotopic composition. The alpha specific activity of Pu obtained by the method studied was in excellent agreement with the value calculated through the isotopic composition. The error involved in determination of specific activity of Pu by this method is within ±1.7%. The alpha specific activity determined by this procedure was successfully employed in determining the Pu concentration of plant samples by radiometric counting technique in spent nuclear fuel reprocessing plants. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd'\n",

The dual-phosphor scintillator-based continuous air monitor (DPCAM) is an instrument to measure airborne of alpha and beta radioactivities. The functionality of the detector, photomultiplier tube (PMT) along with electronics of DPCAM, is to be tested at periodic intervals to ensure reliability. This paper describes the development of a technique for remote online performance evaluation of PMT along with its electronics, using an LED light source activated from the central monitoring station. A detailed study was made on the response of DPCAM subjected to a pulsed light source of different wavelengths using LEDs. The most suitable LED was selected based on alpha-beta pulse discrimination with zero crosstalk and minimum relative intrinsic error for the full range. The selected LED was fixed on PMT. The DPCAM test circuit was designed and developed for the generation of test frequency to drive this LED. A dedicated radiation data acquisition system was configured using ZigBee wireless network. The remote online performance evaluation of the prototype DPCAM was carried out using loaded filter paper in the field and alpha-beta radioactive sources along with the pulsed light source. The real-time trend graphs generated during the evaluation provides five-point calibration, verification of relative intrinsic error, and verification of crosstalk between alpha-beta channels. © 2012 IEEE.'\n",
      " 'EPDM chlorobutyl rubber blends in γ-radiation and hydrocarbon environment: Mechanical, transport, and ageing behaviorIn nuclear applications, ethylene propylene diene monomer (EPDM) rubber is the material of choice as gaskets and O-rings due to its radiations resistance. In nuclear fuel reprocessing, in addition to radiation, the elastomeric components have to withstand paraffinic hydrocarbons as well. But, EPDM has poor resistance to hydrocarbons. To enhance the durability of EPDM in such environments, EPDM–chlorobutyl rubber (CIIR) blends of varying compositions were developed and characterized for mechanical, thermal, dielectric, and solvent sorption behavior. Spectroscopic and morphological analysis was used to evaluate the compatibility of blends. Due to synergistic effect, the optimal composition of blends with superior mechanical properties and solvent resistance were found to be 60% to 80% EPDM and 20% to 40% CIIR. The optimized blends were irradiated with gamma rays at cumulative doses up to 2 MGy. Based on spectroscopic, morphological, mechanical, thermogravimetric, and sorption properties, blend containing 80% EPDM was found to have superior retention of properties after irradiation. © 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

The nc-ThO2 powders were characterized for their bulk density, size distribution of particles, specific surface area, carbon residue and X-ray crystallite size. All these powders were compacted at pressures varying from 60 to 353 MPa and sintered by using the “two-step sintering” method. Powders prepared from a mixture with an “R” value of 0.125 compacted at 243 MPa yielded a maximum sintered density of 98.8 ± 0.3% T.D. For nc-ThO2, this is the highest sintered density reported so far. The microstructural investigations on nc-ThO2 powders were carried out by using both scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). SEM images of the sintered thoria monoliths revealed faceted grains with well defined grain boundaries.

Within the framework of weak interactions, the π-stacking interactions are considered unconventional with the limited experimental proofs, wherein the bonding associates are either aromatic and heterocyclic compounds or their combinations. Besides aromatic compounds, π-stacking networks can even be realized with molecules possessing electron rich π-clouds. In this work, the N2 molecule as a possible π-bonding partner is explored for the first time in which hetero π-stacking was achieved between pyrrole and N2 precursors. The matrix isolation experiments performed by seeding pyrrole and N2 mixtures in an Ar matrix at low temperatures with subsequent infrared spectral characterization revealed the generation of adducts stabilized through a π(pyrrole)···π(N2) interaction.

      " 'Extraction and coordination behavior of diphenyl hydrogen phosphine oxide towards actinidesExtraction behavior of some selected actinides like U(VI), Th(IV), and Am(III) was investigated with three different H-phosphine oxides, viz. diphenyl hydrogen phosphine oxide (DPhPO), dihexyl hydrogen phosphine oxide (DHePO) and diphenyl phosphite (DPP). The H-phosphine oxides exhibited a dual nature towards the extraction of actinides where the ligand not only extracts the metals by cation exchange but also by coordination with the phosphoryl group at lower and higher acidic concentrations, respectively. Among all ligands employed, DPhPO showed highest extraction with actinides with a substituent dependent trend as follows: DPhPO\\xa0andgt;\\xa0DHePO\\xa0andgt;\\xa0DPP. This trend emphasizes the importance of substituents around the phosphine oxide towards their extraction of actinides. The coordination behavior of DPhPO was studied by investigating its corresponding complexes with Th(NO3)4 and UO2(NO3)2. The metal complexes of these actinides were characterized using FT-IR, 1H and 31P NMR spectroscopic techniques.

      " 'Estimation of Tb3+ by mellitic acid sensitized luminescence in methanolMellitic acid sensitized luminescence of Tb3+ in methanol exhibits a strong emission which is about 500 times more intense than that observed in water. Under optimal conditions, the luminescence intensity exhibits an excellent linear relationship in the concentration range of 5 × 10-10–5 × 10-8 M with a detection limit of 3 × 10-11 M. The interferences due to other lanthanides have been examined and found to be tolerated up to about 100-fold excess and hence estimation of Tb3+ in the presence of excess of lanthanides is possible. This method has been applied to the estimation of Tb3+ in simulated rare earth and tap water samples and the result is comparable to the result obtained from ICP-MS. Mechanism of enhanced luminescence is also proposed. This is the first report where mellitic acid sensitized luminescence is applied for the estimation of Tb3+.'\n",
      " 'Iron phosphate glasses: Bulk properties and atomic scale structureBulk properties such as glass transition temperature, density and thermal expansion of iron phosphate glass compositions, with replacement of Cs by Ba, are investigated as a surrogate for the transmutation of 137Cs to 137Ba, relevant to the immobilisation of Cs in glass. These studies are required to establish the appropriate incorporation rate of 137Cs in iron phosphate glass. Density and glass transition temperature increases with the addition of BaO indicating the shrinkage and reticulation of the iron phosphate glass network. The average thermal expansion coefficient reduces from 19.8 × 10−6 K−1 to 13.4 × 10−6 K−1, when 25 wt. % of Cs2O was replaced by 25 wt. % of BaO in caesium loaded iron phosphate glass. In addition to the above bulk properties, the role of Ba as a network modifier in the structure of iron phosphate glass is examined using various spectroscopic techniques. The FeII content and average coordination number of iron in the glass network was estimated using Mössbauer spectroscopy. The FeII content in the un-doped iron phosphate glass and barium doped iron phosphate glasses was 20, 21 and 22 ± 1% respectively and the average Fe coordination varied from 5.3 ± 0.2 to 5.7 ± 0.2 with increasing Ba content. The atomic scale structure was further probed by Fe K-edge X-ray absorption spectroscopy.

Micro-Raman spectroscopy has been used to investigate the structural stability of these samples up to pressures of ∼50 GPa in a diamond anvil cell at room temperature. The results are compared with the pressure dependence of Raman spectra of bulk thoria that undergoes a structural transition from fluorite to cotunnite structure around 38 GPa. We observed a linear dependence of the first order Raman band on pressure up to 20 GPa. The pressure dependence of this most prominent single Raman band is similar for nano and bulk phases suggesting that they have similar compressibilities. This band exhibits normal stiffening behaviour under compression. Phase transition pressures of different sized fluorite type nanocrystalline ThO2 are found to be less than that reported for bulk ThO2 except for the one with 9 nm average diameter. Under hydrostatic conditions, the compression and decompression cycles show large hysteresis. Moreover, the reduction of crystallite size results in a sluggish dynamic process in the pressure-induced phase transformation of nano-ThO2. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.'\n",

TBP was trapped in a N2 matrix using both effusive and supersonic sources, and its infrared spectra were recorded. The computational exploration of TBP is a very demanding problem to confront, due to the presence of a large multitude of conformations in TBP. To simplify the problem, computations were done on model compounds, dimethyl butyl phosphate (DMBP) and dibutyl methyl phosphate (DBMP), to systematically arrive at the conformations of TBP that are expected to contribute to its chemistry at room temperature. Some predictive rules seem to simplify this complex conformational landscape problem. The predictive rules that were formulated enabled us to search the relevant portion of the conformational topography of this molecule. The computations were performed at the B3LYP level of theory using the 6-31++G(d,p) basis set.

The structure of the complexes and the energies were computed at B3LYP and B3LYP+D3 levels of theory using 6–311++G (d, p) and aug-cc-pVDZ basis sets. DFT computations indicated two minima corresponding to the C-H⋯N (global) and C-H⋯π interactions (local) of 1:1 C2H2-C6H5CN complexes, where C2H2 is the proton donor in both complexes. Experimentally, the 1:1 C-H⋯N complex identified from the shifts in the C-H and C[tbnd]N stretching modes corresponding to the C2H2 and C6H5CN sub-molecules in N2 and Ar matrices. Atoms in Molecules and Natural Bond Orbital analyses were performed to understand the nature of interaction and to unravel the reasons for red-shifting of the C-H stretching frequency in these complexes. Energy decomposition analysis was carried out to discern the various stabilizing and destabilizing components as a result of hydrogen bonding in the C2H2-C6H5CN complexes. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.'\n",

Also, the third phase formation tendency of TsBP is lower compared to its isomers, Tri-n-butyl-phosphate (TBP) and Tri-iso-butyl phosphate (TiBP). In this context, the extraction and third phase formation behaviour of 1.1 M solutions of TiBP and TsBP in n-dodecane in the extraction of Th(IV) from 1 M HNO3 at 303 K over a wide range of Th concentrations were investigated in the present study and the results are compared with the literature data on TBP system. Concentrations of Th(IV) and HNO3 loaded in the organic phase before third phase formation (biphasic region) as well as in third phase and diluent-rich phase after third phase formation (triphasic region) were measured as a function of equilibrium aqueous phase Th(IV) concentration. The density of loaded organic phase was also measured at various Th(IV) concentrations. The extraction profiles in the biphasic region indicated that extraction of Th(IV) by TBP is higher than that of TiBP which in turn is higher than that of TsBP. Extractant concentration in the diluent-rich phase and third phase was measured for the triphasic region. © 2017 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston.'\n",

It is revealed from our calculations that doping of Ni into BiFeO3 lattice results in structural distortions and increases the Fe[sbnd]O[sbnd]Fe and O[sbnd]Fe[sbnd]O bond angle. The Ni-doped BiFeO3 exhibits half-metallicity rather than the usual insulating nature of BiFeO3 due to the hybridization of both Fe and Ni 3d states with O 2p states at the Fermi level and these materials find applications in spintronics. In addition, Ni2+ establishes a ferrimagnetic exchange interaction with neighboring Fe3+ ions and the change in the magnetic state (from antiferromagnetic to ferrimagnetic) occurs. The presence of 3d electrons in the magnetically active Fe/Ni atoms leads to the existence of double exchange interactions via Fe3+[sbnd]O2−[sbnd]Ni2+ hybridization. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.'\n",

      " 'Photooxidation of Trimethyl Phosphite in Nitrogen, Oxygen, and para-Hydrogen Matrixes at Low Temperatures(Chemical Equation Presented) Trimethyl phosphite (TMPhite) was photooxidized to trimethyl phosphate (TMP) in N2, O2, and para-H2 matrixes at low temperatures to correlate the conformational landscape of these two molecules. The photooxidation produced the trans (TGG)-rich conformer with respect to the ground state gauche (GGG) conformer of TMP in N2 and O2 matrixes, which has diverged from the conformational composition of freshly deposited pure TMP in the low-temperature matrixes. The enrichment of the trans conformer in preference to the gauche conformer of TMP during photooxidation is due to the TMPhite precursor, which exists exclusively in the trans conformer. Interestingly, whereas the photooxidized TMP molecule suffers site effects possibly due to the local asymmetry in N2 and O2 matrixes, in the para-H2 matrix owing to the quantum crystal nature the site effects were observed to be self-repaired. © 2017 American Chemical Society.'\n",

      " 'Inter-atomic potentials for radiation damage studies in CePO4 monaziteAn original empirical potential used for modelling phosphate glasses is adapted to be suitable for use with monazite (CePO4) so as to have a consistent formulation for radiation damage studies of phosphates. This is done by adding a parameterisation for the Ce–O interaction to the existing potential set. The thermal and structural properties of the resulting computer model are compared to experimental results. The parameter set gives a stable monazite structure where the volume of the unit cell is almost identical to that measured experimentally, but with some shrinkage in the a and b lengths and a small expansion in the c direction compared to experiment. The thermal expansion, specific heat capacity and estimates of the melting point are also determined. The estimate of the melting temperature of 2500 K is comparable to the experimental value of 2318 ± 20 K, but the simulated thermal expansion of 49×10-6 K−1 is larger than the usually reported value. The simulated specific heat capacity at constant pressure was found to be approximately constant at 657 J kg−1 K−1 in the range 300–1000 K, however, this is not observed experimentally or in more detailed ab initio calculations. © 2016 The Authors'\n",

Sodium is the heat transfer medium for PFBR, and austenitic steel SS 316LN is the material of construction for the sodium circuits of the reactor. During reactor service, the inner surfaces of the sodium circuit pipelines undergo corrosion by interacting with liquid sodium, forming ferritic layers. Radioactive nuclides formed by the activation of corrosion products are deposited on the ferritic surface, resulting in a radioactive burden on maintenance personnel. Chemical decontamination is generally carried out by dissolving the surface ferritic layer on the inside surface of the sodium circuit. In this context, a study of the dissolution behavior of the ferritic layer on SS 316LN samples formed by exposure to liquid sodium at 823 K was carried out by monitoring the H2 released during the chemical interaction with decontamination formulation. The decontamination chemical formulation was a mixture of sulfuric acid and phosphoric acid.

The parameters were; duration and temperature of electrolysis, open porosity of pellets, nature of anode, mode of electrolysis and configuration of the oxide cathode. The experiments were also conducted in KCl, KCl-25 mol% CaCl2 and NaCl melts to understand the effect of melt composition on the electroreduction. Different Ca-Nb-O and Nb-O intermediates were found in the pellets electrolysed for different durations of time in CaCl2 melt which eventually reduced to Nb. The current efficiency of the process decreased with increasing duration of electrolysis. Decrease in electrolysis temperature from 1173 to 1073 K led to the decrease in the rate of reduction of the oxide pellets. Pellets with high open porosity reduced faster. Carbon contamination of the melt was relatively less when pyrolytic graphite was used as anode.

These studies revealed that the ambient-temperature monoclinic (P21/n) phase reversibly transforms to a tetragonal (I41/amd) structure at higher temperature. Also, from the experimental and theoretical calculations, a possible existence of an orthorhombic (Imma) structure with almost zero orthorhombicity is predicted which is closely related to tetragonal K2Ce(PO4)2. The high-temperature tetragonal phase reverts back to ambient monoclinic phase at much lower temperature in the cooling cycle compared to that observed at the heating cycle. XRD studies revealed the transition is accompanied by volume expansion of about 14.4%. The lower packing density of the high-temperature phase is reflected in its significantly lower thermal expansion coefficient (αV = 3.83 × 10-6 K-1) compared to that in ambient monoclinic phase (αV = 41.30 × 10-6 K-1). The coexistences of low- and high-temperature phases, large volume discontinuity in transition, and large hysteresis of transition temperature in heating and cooling cycles, as well as drastically different structural arrangement are in accordance with the first-order reconstructive nature of the transition. Temperature-dependent Raman spectra indicate significant changes around 783 K attributable to the phase transition. In situ low-temperature XRD, neutron diffraction, and Raman spectroscopic studies revealed no structural transition below ambient temperature. Raman mode frequencies, temperature coefficients, and reduced temperature coefficients for both monoclinic and tetragonal phases of K2Ce(PO4)2 have been obtained.

      " 'Parametric evaluation of tension stiffening effect for reinforced concrete nuclear facility structuresTension stiffening is attributed to the fact that concrete does not crack suddenly and completely but undergoes progressive micro-cracking. This is due to transfer of some amount of tensile force from rebar to bonded concrete area. A parametric study on factors influencing tension stiffening namely reinforcement bond area, reinforcement ratio and shrinkage in concrete are addressed in this paper. A new tension stiffening model is proposed for reinforced concrete members in flexure with two parameters addressing reinforcement and shrinkage influence respectively. Validation of proposed tension stiffening model is made and importance of tension stiffening at serviceability performance limit is presented.'\n",

An enhanced reconstruction method is proposed using Singular Value Decomposition (SVD). In the traditional SVD reconstruction method, the faulty data may affect other fault free data. The enhanced SVD (ESVD) reconstruction method is a robust method to map as a normal data. The statistical hypothesis test, namely Generalized Likelihood Ratio Test (GLRT) is applied to detect the fault in the residual space.

      " 'Nuclear Power Plant Thermocouple Sensor-Fault Detection and Classification Using Deep Learning and Generalized Likelihood Ratio TestIn this paper, an online fault detection and classification method is proposed for thermocouples used in nuclear power plants. In the proposed method, the fault data are detected by the classification method, which classifies the fault data from the normal data. Deep belief network (DBN), a technique for deep learning, is applied to classify the fault data. The DBN has a multilayer feature extraction scheme, which is highly sensitive to a small variation of data. Since the classification method is unable to detect the faulty sensor; therefore, a technique is proposed to identify the faulty sensor from the fault data. Finally, the composite statistical hypothesis test, namely generalized likelihood ratio test, is applied to compute the fault pattern of the faulty sensor signal based on the magnitude of the fault. The performance of the proposed method is validated by field data obtained from thermocouple sensors of the fast breeder test reactor. © 1963-2012 IEEE.'\n",
      " 'Influence of geochemical variation and heavy mineral component on primordial radionuclide presence in Tamiraparani River sedimentsGamma spectral analysis for the presence of primordial radionuclides was done on the sediment samples collected from Tamiraparani River, Tamil Nadu, India, which originates in the Western Ghats and flows towards the eastern side of the high background radiation region of Southern Malabar Coast (Kerala). The average activity concentration values for the primordial radionuclides were observed to be higher than the world median ranges reported by UNSCEAR (Report to general assembly with scientific annexes, vol 1, Annex B. United Nations, New York, http://www.unscear.org/docs/publications/2008/UNSCEAR_2008_Annex-B-CORR.pdf, 2008). The radiological parameters calculated for river sediments were found to be comparatively higher than the recommended values. The computed correlation matrix exhibited a positive correlation between various geochemical parameters and the activity concentration values of the primordial radionuclides. The heavy mineral analysis also showed a noticeable correlation with the activity of the actinides. The solid-state electrical conductivity studies on the heavy mineral samples were investigated to study their correlation with the activity of the primordial radionuclides. © 2017, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.'\n",
      " 'A novel approach for fault detection and classification of the thermocouple sensor in Nuclear Power Plant using Singular Value Decomposition and Symbolic Dynamic FilterA mathematical model with two layers is developed using data-driven methods for thermocouple sensor fault detection and classification in Nuclear Power Plants (NPP). The Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) based method is applied to detect the faulty sensor from a data set of all sensors, at the first layer. In the second layer, the Symbolic Dynamic Filter (SDF) is employed to classify the fault pattern. If SVD detects any false fault, it is also re-evaluated by the SDF, i.e., the model has two layers of checking to balance the false alarms. The proposed fault detection and classification method is compared with the Principal Component Analysis. Two case studies are taken from Fast Breeder Test Reactor (FBTR) to prove the efficiency of the proposed method. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd'\n",

This needs to be stepped up to suit load requirements using a high voltage gain converter. Since renewable sources inherently generate sudden variations in input voltage, a good output voltage profile even during such random variations in input conditions is essential. This paper presents modeling of a high step-up converter configuration with closed loop control. The converter topology is designed to operate with moderate duty ratios and the simple coupled inductor. The converter is capable of high step-up and can find application in solar PV systems. The controller response is good with low steady state error and required dynamics.

      " 'Brackish water RO plant as a variable load for renewables based hybrid power system for increased power outputWater and energy are the two needs that control human lives and propagate civilization. The scarcity of water can be addressed easily if energy is abundant. But we can see that most of the places that are water-stressed are also energy-stressed. Making the normal electricity grid supply available may not be a cost-effective option. Rural/remote locations such as hills and islands often have the problem of both water and energy. Hence there is a need to identify energy sources such solar, wind and biomass that are available locally to cater to water and energy needs. These sources are of intermittent nature and hence there is a need to store the energy when available. Also, combination of two or more of these renewable sources is also required to meet the demands. These are known as hybrid power system. This paper carries out an analysis of various sizing combinations of systems with solar photovoltaic, wind energy and stored energy in batteries for production of drinking water from a brackish water source. When the power produced is less than that required by the load, the generated power has to be stored in a battery and again discharged when required. We propose a BWRO plant that can take reduced power input also and reduced water output under such conditions and thus reduce the need of higher capacity of storage batteries. The system can operate the RO plant whenever the power is available, produce drinking water and store in a tank. This paper analyses the model of the entire hybrid power system in MATLAB to simulate the performance of the hybrid power system for different combinations of capacities.

      " 'Weighted-SMOTE: A modification to SMOTE for event classification in sodium cooled fast reactorsTraditionally, the plight of imbalanced dataset and its classification quandary has been counteracted mostly using under-sampling, over-sampling or ensemble sampling methods. Among these algorithms, Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE) which belongs to oversampling method has had lot of admiration and extensive range of practical applications. SMOTE algorithm works on the principle of oversampling of minority data samples by generating synthetic data. The oversampling happens with respect to each minority sample and eventually it leads to oversampling of the minority data set. In this paper, SMOTE has been modified to Weighted-SMOTE (WSMOTE) where oversampling of each minority data sample is carried out based on the weight assigned to it. These weights are determined by using the Euclidean distance of a particular minority data sample with respect to all the remaining minority data samples. Each minority data sample need not generate equal number of synthetic data in WSMOTE as in the case of SMOTE. The performances of the classifiers based on SMOTE and WSMOTE are compared using few real datasets and eventually tested on events in a sodium cooled fast reactor. Recall and F-measure from the confusion matrix have been identified as the principal metrics to evaluate the performance of the classifier. It is seen that WSMOTE performs better than SMOTE algorithm. © 2017'\n",
      " 'Feasibility of ANFIS towards multiclass event classification in PFBR considering dimensionality reduction using PCANuclear power plant (NPP) such as Prototype Fast Breeder Reactor (PFBR), is a paradigm of complex engineering which is safety critical in nature. It sends copious plant signals to the main control room. An amalgamation of plenty of such plant signals escorts an operator to make appropriate decision during catastrophic circumstances. This decision must be quick and unambiguous in order to overcome any adverse situation. The concept of dimensionality reduction aids the purpose as it reduces the number of inputs to any system or model or classifier which ultimately makes the decision process faster. The fundamental aspect which should be taken paramount care is that there should not be any loss of information due to dimensionality reduction, as in a NPP, safety is the foremost goal. One of the most prevalently used dimensionality reduction algorithms is principal component analysis (PCA). This is achieved by dumping the principal components which has less variability. In this paper, the feasibility of dimensionality reduction is studied for classification of some of the events in PFBR. Two cases are considered in this paper out of which in first one, the event is divided into two sub events such as primary and secondary part of the event based on the importance of classification. The event data is fed to two separate classifiers which classify both the parts of the event separately. Finally, the event is classified as the concatenation of the outputs of both the classifiers. Unlike the first case, where two classifiers identify the event, here, in second case, a single classifier does the event classification. The classifier used is the adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system (ANFIS). This classifier has the advantage of both neural networks and fuzzy system where the neural network concept is used to tune the fuzzy membership function. PCA is used for dimensionality reduction and scree test for factor analysis. The performance of the PCA-ANFIS classifier is measured by calculating the area under the receiver operating characteristics curve (AUC) which is one of the most popularly used performance measures for any classifier. A comparative study is done on the AUC of all the PCA-k-ANFIS classifiers for both the cases mentioned above. Here, k represents the number of principal components considered as input data to the ANFIS classifier. A study on the significance of PCA along with ANFIS is also carried out by comparing it with an ANFIS classifier without using PCA. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd'\n",
      " \"Hardware obfuscation using different obfuscation cell structures for PLDsIn recent years, hardware obfuscation is one of the prominent anti-tamper solutions that are highly used against various hardware security threats such as piracy, cloning, reverse engineering, chip overbuilding, and hardware Trojans. Logic obfuscation is implemented either in the design description (for soft/firm/hard codes) or structure (for the chip) of electronic hardware to intentionally conceal its functionality. Most of the obfuscation schemes enable the circuit operation in two distinct modes such as obfuscated and normal modes. The mode control, mostly implemented by finite state machine, is performed by the application of a specific sequence of input vectors on initialization, called an 'initialization key.' Without the initialization key, it is difficult to comprehend the intended functional behavior of the circuit; hence, circuit tampering or malicious insertion will have a high probability of either becoming functionally benign or easily detectable by conventional logic testing. However, most of the existing obfuscation techniques have used similar obfuscation cell structures throughout the design which in turn leaves a hint to the adversary about circuit obfuscation during reverse engineering. In this paper, we aimed to mitigate this limitation by applying design obfuscation using different obfuscation cells. We performed the hardware obfuscation mechanism for field programmable gate array devices using standard ISCAS'89 benchmark circuits in Actel's ProAsic3 device by Libero SoC v10.1 (free version). We measured the performance overhead using the design parameters such as area, delay, and power. © 2017 The authors and IOS Press.\"\n",
      " 'Heavy metal contamination, major ion chemistry and appraisal of the groundwater status in coastal aquifer, Kalpakkam, Tamil Nadu, IndiaA total of 228 groundwater samples were collected at a depth of 10–30 feet below ground level (bgl) during one year period from nineteen wells around Kalpakkam, Tamil Nadu, India which is known for nuclear installations. The studied aquifer mainly constitutes of sand and weathered charnockite with thickness varying from 3 to 12\\xa0m and is of unconfined nature. Physical parameters, major ions, and heavy metals level were compared with guideline values and water quality index. The order of dominance of cations and anions were; Na+andgt;Ca+2andgt;Mg+2andgt;K+ and HCO3 −andgt;Cl−andgt;NO3 −andgt;SO4 −2andgt;PO4 −3andgt;Br−andgt;F−. Four major water types (Ca-HCO3, Na-Cl, mixed Ca-Na-HCO3 and mixed Ca-Mg-Cl) were observed. Alkali metals (Na++K+) exceeded the alkaline earth (Ca+2+Mg+2) and weak acid (HCO3−) exceeded the strong acid (Cl−+SO4 −). The order of heavy metals was Znandgt;Feandgt;Mnandgt;Niandgt;Cu. Bureau of Indian Standards compliance of total dissolved solids (26–27%), total alkalinity (35–44%), total hardness (24–27%) and nitrate (41–43%) indicated that most of the samples exceeded the acceptable limit for drinking water. High nitrate level with an average of 104.5\\xa0mg/l (82% samples exceeded BIS limit) was observed in the central part of the study area (between Kalpakkam township and nuclear site) and ascribed to the influence of domestic sewage and septic tank effluents. Observed low fluoride values in this study (avg. 0.1\\xa0mg/l) contradicted the earlier report of high level of fluoride from this location. Based on the Canadian Council of Ministers of the Environment Water Quality Index (CCME WQI), the water quality was classified as marginal to excellent class with a majority falling under fair category. Except for 4–5 wells which were categorized as marginal, the water quality in other wells was suitable for drinking. The studied wells formed spatial distinct groups based on the water quality ranking. The present study provides a comprehensive status of groundwater quality in terms of its suitability for human consumption. © 2017'\n",
      " 'Analysis of composition and temperature of debris bed based on settling characteristics of relocated core debris in pool type SFRThe hypothetical core meltdown accident in sodium cooled fast reactors (SFR) is a severe accident situation during which the energetic dispersion of core materials and their relocation may pose a threat to the integrity of reactor containment. During core meltdown accident, part of the molten core materials relocated downwards would be fragmented in the lower plenum sodium pool and settle over the in-vessel core catcher plate and forms a particulate debris bed. The recriticality potential and coolability of the debris bed are strongly influenced by the composition of fragmented particles of different core materials and their size distribution. In this paper, simplified models have been developed to evaluate the incipient conditions i.e., composition profile and initial temperature of the particulate debris bed formed over an in-vessel core catcher plate following the core meltdown accident in pool type SFR. The particle mixture settling process subsequent to the fragmentation of molten core materials in sodium pool has been analyzed to evaluate the composition profile of the debris bed. A 1-D model for particle motion through the stagnant fluid under the influence of gravity has been considered to evaluate the settling characteristics of core materials debris (mainly UO2 and stainless steel) in liquid sodium for a wide range of possible sizes. By extending this model, the differential settling behaviour of mixture of UO2 and stainless steel particles in liquid sodium pool has been investigated. The composition profile of the debris bed along its thickness has been evaluated for the material relocation scenario considered with various mass ratios of stainless steel and UO2 mixture using the published experimental results based particle size distributions. Further, a 1-D transient conduction model is implemented to estimate the temperature of debris particles when they settle on the core catcher plate. Simulations revealed that the particles will be quenched to near the temperature of the liquid sodium in lower pool while reaching the core catcher. The results are useful in assessing the coolability characteristics of debris bed formed on the core catcher and its recriticality potential in the analysis of the Post Accident Heat Removal. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.'\n",

The enclosure considered is a geometrical model of the lower plenum of a typical pool type SFR main vessel with the in-vessel type core catcher assembly. Aim of this study is to analyze the decay heat removal rate from horizontally spread core debris on the core catcher during post accident heat removal (PAHR) condition under core meltdown scenario in SFR and correlate the same with the associated non-dimensional parameters. The mass, momentum and energy conservation equations have been numerically solved in cylindrical co-ordinates using finite volume method and using SIMPLE algorithm for pressure-velocity coupling. Turbulence has been modelled using k-ε model and the computational model is validated against benchmark numerical and experimental studies on natural convection found in literature. PAHR has been simulated under two scenarios of decay heat removal (DHR), viz., under pump driven DHR condition above the lower plenum (i.e., under Total Instantaneous coolant Blockage (TIB) scenario) and under completely passive DHR condition (i.e., under Unprotected Loss Of Flow Accident (ULOFA) scenario). Nusselt number (Nu) is correlated as a function of Bo∗ for natural convection above the debris bed on the top surface of the core catcher and also below the bottom surface of the core catcher. These conservative correlations can be used in the design of in-vessel core catcher in pool-type SFR in order to ensure safe retention of radioactivity within the primary containment system even under whole core accident scenarios (WCA). © 2017 Elsevier B.V.'\n",

As information security is of utmost priority to such organizations, achieving the same is a challenging task while using the public network like the internet. Though cryptography could be used to enhance the information security, it cannot hide its own presence from the attackers. This drawback lead security professionals to look for an alternate technique like steganography. Steganography hides the secret information, stealthily, inside another innocent looking cover medium like text, image, audio and video. Considering these, this paper proposes a novel text steganographic algorithm that embeds images as codes in the font attributes such as color, character spacing and kerning. The procedure of representing an image as codes makes the proposed method independent from the resolution of the image. Experiments were conducted by embedding diverse categories of images. A comparison with the best existing method depicted that the embedding capacity attained by the proposed method is higher at 1.59-bits/character, which suits best for low bandwidth environments. Various security aspects of the proposed method have also been discussed.'\n",
      " 'Numerical simulation of tropical cyclone thane: role of boundary layer and surface drag parameterization schemesIn the recent times, several advanced numerical models are utilized for the prediction of the intensity, track and landfall time of a cyclone. Still there are number of issues concerning their prediction and the limitation of numerical models in addressing those issues. The most pertinent question is how intensive a cyclone can become before it makes a landfall and where the cyclone moves under the ambient large-scale flow. In this paper, detailed study has been carried out using Weather Research Forecast model with two boundary schemes to address the above question by considering a recent tropical cyclone in Bay of Bengal region of North Indian Ocean. In addition, the impact of the surface drag effect on the low-level winds and the intensity of the cyclone are also studied. The result reveals that large differences are noted in the ocean surface fluxes between YSU and MYJ with MYJ producing relatively higher fluxes than YSU. It is found that the YSU scheme produced a better simulation for the THANE cyclone in terms of winds, pressure distribution and cloud fractions. Comparison with available observations indicated the characteristics of horizontal divergence, vorticity and vector track positions produced by YSU experiment are more realistic than with MYJ and other experiments. However, when the drag coefficient is changed as 0.5 or 2.0 from the default values, appreciable changes in the surface fluxes are not noticed. A maximum precipitation is reported in YSU as compared to the MYJ PBL scheme for the tropical cyclone THANE. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media B.V.'\n",

The model inverts the measured dose rates to the airborne radioactive release rate using the dilution factors predicted by a random-walk particle atmospheric dispersion model called System for Prediction of Environmental Emergency Dose Information (SPEEDI) taking into account the real-time meteorological observations and location coordinates of the gamma radiation detectors. A point-kernel method for estimating the cloud-gamma dose rates at receptor locations is implemented in SPEEDI for this purpose. ASTER is validated against Ar-41 routine release data from a pressurized heavy-water reactor (PHWR) at Kalpakkam for over 100\\xa0days covering different seasons during 2014–2015. Comparison of ASTER-simulated overhead plume gamma dose rates with the measured dose rates at detector points gives a correlation of R\\xa0=\\xa00.59, bias of 89\\xa0nGy/h, and RMSE of 104.09\\xa0nGy/h indicating a slight overestimation of gamma dose rates at monitor points.

Human peripheral blood samples exposed to ten different doses (0, 0.05, 0.1, 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 Gy) of 6 MV X-rays and 60Co γ-rays were subjected to Dicentric Chromosome Assay (DCA) and dicentrics, excess acentric fragments (AF) and chromatid breaks (CB) were scored. Totally about 31,553 metaphase spreads were scored for the purpose. Dose response curves of both radiation qualities were almost same except for a 13.8% higher β value for 6 MV X-rays. However, blind tests results revealed that both these curves are biologically equivalent and exhibited good dose prediction accuracy for the entire dose range. This demonstrated the feasibility of interchangeable use of these curves in biodosimetry.

In this method, the transmitted intensity of radiation is measured and then correlated to dimensional variations or gross defects, such as voids in materials. India has embarked on a three-stage nuclear programme, with the second stage focusing on sodium-cooled fast reactors. At Kalpakkam, an indigenously-designed 500 MWe prototype fast breeder reactor (PFBR) using mixed oxide as fuel and sodium as coolant is under construction. This is a pool-type reactor in which the entire in-core components will be immersed in sodium. As liquid sodium is opaque to visible light and conventional visual methods based on charge-coupled devices (CCD) cannot be used, ultrasound waves are used to visualise the components immersed in sodium. It is essential to know the position and protrusion of fuel sub-assemblies inside the core. An innovative, ultrasonic under-sodium scanner (USUSS) has been developed for this purpose. USUSS is a slender structure consisting of two detachable parts known as the lower and upper parts. This shield plug is designed to protect personnel and components from the intense gamma radiation. In this paper, the authors focus on the application of radiometric testing for evaluating the integrity and shielding effectiveness of the shield plug. A 60Co source of strength 31.5 MBq was used as the source and measurements were made using a NaI(Tl)-based portable gamma spectrometer. Radiometric testing confirmed that all dimensional variations were well within the 3% tolerance limits and the material was free from major voids and defects.'\n",

Substantial increase in pH (Palar 8.05; open reservoir 8.45), dissolved oxygen (mg\\xa0l−1) (Palar 6.07; open reservoir 8.47), and chlorophyll-a (mg m−3) (Palar 1.66; open reservoir 8.43) values were noticed from the Palar sub-soil water to open reservoir water. It is concluded that sub-soil water with higher nutrient concentrations when stored openly, exposing to the sun, resulted in growth of plants, planktonic, and macrophytes, which led to substantial deterioration in water quality from its utility point of view as a condenser cooling medium and raw water input for DM plant. © 2017, Springer International Publishing AG.'\n",
      " 'Determination of efficiency of an aged HPGe detector for gaseous sources by self absorption correction and point source methodsMethods for the determination of efficiency of an aged high purity germanium (HPGe) detector for gaseous sources have been presented in the paper. X-ray radiography of the detector has been performed to get detector dimensions for computational purposes. The dead layer thickness of HPGe detector has been ascertained from experiments and Monte Carlo computations. Experimental work with standard point and liquid sources in several cylindrical geometries has been undertaken for obtaining energy dependant efficiency. Monte Carlo simulations have been performed for computing efficiencies for point, liquid and gaseous sources. Self absorption correction factors have been obtained using mathematical equations for volume sources and MCNP simulations. Self-absorption correction and point source methods have been used to estimate the efficiency for gaseous sources. The efficiencies determined from the present work have been used to estimate activity of cover gas sample of a fast reactor. © 2017 IOP Publishing Ltd and Sissa Medialab.'\n",
      " 'Synthesis and photoluminescence behaviour of dysprosium doped barium bismuth borate glassesDysprosium doped barium bismuth borate glasses (BBOD) with the chemical composition (75-x) H3BO3+ 15BaCO3+ 10 Bi2O3 + x Dy2O3 (where x= 0.05, 0.1, 0.25in wt %) were prepared by melt quenching method. XRD analysis was used to confirm the amorphous nature. The prepared glass sample was characterised through optical absorption and fluorescence spectra. The presence of stretching and bending vibrational modes of borates (BO3, BO4 and non-bridging oxygen atoms) in the prepared glasses were explored through FTIR analysis. Thermal analysis reveals the homogenous formation of the glasses. The glass transition temperatures were also obtained from the DSC spectra. Photoluminescence spectra of the prepared glasses reveal two intense emission bands in the visible regions (blue and yellow). The x, y color chromaticity coordinates of the prepared glasses were analysed using a CIE 1931 color chromaticity diagramand it is presented. © 2017, National Institute of Optoelectronics.

      " 'Entrance surface dose and induced DNA damage in blood lymphocytes of patients exposed to low-dose and low-dose-rate X-irradiation during diagnostic and therapeutic interventional radiology proceduresThe ionizing radiation received by patients and health workers due to radiological imaging may increase the risks of radiation effects, such as cancer and cataracts. We have investigated the dose received by specific areas around the head and related this to DNA damage in the blood lymphocytes of subjects exposed to interventional imaging. The entrance surface doses (ESD) to the forehead, neck, and shoulder were measured with a thermoluminescence dosimeter (CaSO4 disc or polycrystalline powder of lithium tetraborate doped with Mn) and compared with that of dose area product (DAP). DNA damage was measured by γ-H2AX, p53ser15, chromosomal aberration (CA), and micronucleus (MN) assays in lymphocytes of patients (n\\xa0=\\xa075), before and 2 and 24\\xa0h after exposure. The measured ESD values were 230.5\\xa0±\\xa04.9, 189.5\\xa0±\\xa03.55 and 90.7\\xa0±\\xa03.4\\xa0mGy for the forehead, neck, and shoulder, respectively. The DAP varied from 1.8 to 2047 Gy*cm2, showing a correlation with fluoroscopy time (r\\xa0=\\xa00.417).

      " \"Silica-Coated Europium-Doped Gadolinium Oxide Nanorods for Dual-Modal Imaging of Cancer CellsDual-modal imaging of cancer cells is possible with the silica-coated europium-doped gadolinium oxide nanorods due to their magnetic and luminescent properties. In the synthesized nanorods, europium ions serve as 'luminescent centers' facilitating optical imaging and gadolinium oxide acts as the contrast agent for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). This article reports the synthesis method of the europium-doped gadolinium oxide (Eu:Gd2O3) nanorods by the co-precipitation method. The prepared nanorods are further coated with silica to improve its biocompatibility. From the x-ray difraction (XRD) data, the crystallinity was found to decrease due to the amorphous nature of the silica. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) studies show that Eu:Gd2O3 nanorods with a length of ∼600nm and diameter of ∼40nm were formed. Silica was coated uniformly with the thickness of ∼15nm. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) confirms the presence of silica in the prepared nanorods. Emission at 611nm due the presence of Eu3+ ions was observed. The life time of uncoated and silica-coated nanorods was calculated to be 1.1ms and 0.9ms, respectively. In vitro cytotoxicity of the synthesized nanorods in MG63 (human osteosarcoma cell line) was assessed by MTT assay. In vitro MRI studies reveal that the prepared nanorods can be used for T1 contrast enhancement. © 2017 World Scientific Publishing Company.\"\n",

      " 'Climatic features of the Red Sea from a regional assimilative modelThe Advanced Research version of Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF-ARW) model was used to generate a downscaled, 10-km resolution regional climate dataset over the Red Sea and adjacent region. The model simulations are performed based on two, two-way nested domains of 30- and 10-km resolutions assimilating all conventional observations using a cyclic three-dimensional variational approach over an initial 12-h period. The improved initial conditions are then used to generate regional climate products for the following 24 h. We combined the resulting daily 24-h datasets to construct a 15-year Red Sea atmospheric downscaled product from 2000 to 2014. This 15-year downscaled dataset is evaluated via comparisons with various in situ and gridded datasets. Our analysis indicates that the assimilated model successfully reproduced the spatial and temporal variability of temperature, wind, rainfall, relative humidity and sea level pressure over the Red Sea region. The model also efficiently simulated the seasonal and monthly variability of wind patterns, the Red Sea Convergence Zone and associated rainfall. Our results suggest that dynamical downscaling and assimilation of available observations improve the representation of regional atmospheric features over the Red Sea compared to global analysis data from the National Centers for Environmental Prediction. We use the dataset to describe the atmospheric climatic conditions over the Red Sea region. © 2016 Royal Meteorological Society'\n",
      " 'Environmental impact on diversity and distribution of tintinnid (Ciliata: Protozoa) along Hooghly Estuary, India: A multivariate approachThe spatiotemporal distribution, diversity and biomass of the choreotrich ciliate tintinnid, the ubiquitous planktonic protist, were analysed from nine sampling sites (=252) of diverse environmental stresses along the Hooghly Estuary, eastern part of India during March 2012 to August 2014. Among 32 identified tintinnid species, the agglomerated genera Tintinnopsis (20 sp), dominated the community (∼62%) followed by Tintinnidium (2 sp), Leprotintinnus (2 sp), Codonellopsis, Stenosemella, Helicostomella, Favella, Eutintinnus, Metacylis, Dadayiellaand Wangiella (each comprising single species). A wide range of seasonal variations in tintinnid abundance was recorded maximum (2067±893\\xa0ind.\\xa0l−1) for Tintinnopsis beroidea and minimum (11±4\\xa0ind.\\xa0l−1) for Metacylis sp. during the investigation period. The biomass and daily production rate of tintinnid ranged from 0.004–2.764\\xa0μg\\xa0C\\xa0l−1 and 0.04–3.54\\xa0μg\\xa0C\\xa0l−1 \\xa0day−1 respectively.

      " 'Performance of WRF in simulating terrain induced flows and atmospheric boundary layer characteristics over the tropical station GadankiIn this study the evolution of the topographic flows and boundary layer features over a tropical hilly station Gadanki in southern India were simulated using Advanced Research WRF (ARW) mesoscale model for fair weather days during southwest monsoon (20–22 July 2011) and winter (18–20 Jan. 2011). Turbulence measurements from an Ultra High Frequency (UHF) Wind Profiler, Ultra Sonic Anemometer, GPS Sonde and meteorological tower were used for comparison. Simulations revealed development of small-scale slope winds in the lower boundary layer (below 800 m) at Gadanki which are more prevalent during nighttime. Stronger slope winds during winter and weaker flows in the monsoon season are simulated indicating the sensitivity of slope winds to the background synoptic flows and radiative heating/cooling. Higher upward surface fluxes (sensible, latent heat) and development of very deep convective boundary layer (~ 2500 m) is simulated during summer monsoon relative to the winter season in good agreement with observations. Four PBL parameterizations (YSU, MYJ, MYNN and ACM) were evaluated to simulate the above characteristics. Large differences were noticed in the simulated boundary layer features using different PBL schemes in both the seasons. It is found that the TKE-closures (MYJ, MYNN) produced extremities in daytime PBL depth, surface fluxes, temperature, humidity and winds. The differences in the simulations are attributed to the eddy diffusivities, buoyancy and entrainment fluxes which were simulated differently in the respective schemes. The K-based YSU followed by MYNN best produced the slope winds as well as daytime boundary layer characteristics realistically in both the summer and winter synoptic conditions at Gadanki hilly site though with slight overestimation of nocturnal PBL height. © 2016'\n",

      " 'Concentration of heavy metals in the food chain components of the nearshore coastal waters of Kalpakkam, southeast coast of IndiaKalpakkam, located on the southeast coast of India, has witnessed intense nuclear power plant activities resulting in a substantial increase in social and industrial development. This has prompted the study of the concentrations of heavy metals in water, sediment, zooplankton and fish in the coastal waters of Kalpakkam to understand their pattern of distribution and bioaccumulation. The concentrations of metals were in the order Fe > Zn > Pb > Cr > Mn > Ni > Cu > Cd > Co in water, Fe > Zn > Mn > Pb > Cr > Cu > Ni > Cd > Co in zooplankton, Fe > Zn > Cu > Mn > Cr > Pb in fish and Fe > Cu > Zn > Pb > Cr > Ni > Cd in sediment. Metal concentrations in plankton were much higher than those in water, sediment and fish. The results showed wide variations in heavy metal concentrations in four food web components. The major sources of metals on the Kalpakkam coast are land-based anthropogenic ones. The coastal sediment is moderately polluted with Cu and Cd. Relatively low dissolved metal concentrations were observed when compared to other coastal waters. However, the results indicated that dermal absorption (CDIdermal) of Fe might be a matter of concern due to its carcinogenicity. The summer season had higher Metal Pollution Index (MPI) values, than the rest of the year. Metal pollution indices indicated that southwest monsoon (SWM) and northeast monsoon (NEM) periods had lower contamination (MPI: 1.0–2.0; Class-III) than the summer season (MPI: 2.0–4.0; Class-IV). The bioaccumulation of metal is faster and the content is much higher in zooplankton than in fish. Bioconcentration factors (BCF) were significantly different for different metals. Amongst the toxic metals the BCF was highest for Cr for both zooplankton and fish tissue. The metal concentrations in the fish species studied were sufficiently low that the fish tissue was safe for human consumption. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd'\n",

The effect of metallic incorporation (Cd2+) on the crystal growth and characteristic properties of LSMH single crystal was studied. The grown crystals are subjected to powder X-ray diffraction studies to explore the structural properties of the pure and doped crystals. The dopant concentration of the crystal is estimated by inductively coupled plasma-optical emission spectroscopy. The crystal showed a 20% transmission enhancement on doping with Cd. Photoluminescence studies showed a violet fluorescence emission peak at 395 nm. The photoluminescence intensity of Cd-doped LSMH increased significantly to about 1.5 times that of pure LSMH. Laser damage threshold value and second-harmonic conversion efficiency of the grown crystals has been determined using Nd:YAG laser operating at 532 and 1064\\xa0nm, respectively.

Median values varied from -0.08ø to 2.19 ø with an average of 1.04 ø (Std ± 0.65 ø). Mean value showed that samples were fine to coarse sand, whereas, only 1.8% of total samples were found as very coarse sand. During southwest monsoon the average mean size of the beach sediment was 0.98 ø, which is coarse sand in contrast to the medium sand observed during other seasons. Present study showed that, 81.7% of the samples were unimodal and 17.8% samples were bimodal. Sediment samples were very well sorted (0.18 ø) to poorly sorted (1.18 ø) and sorting characteristics decreased with increased wave energy. Skewness value indicated that 41% and 11% of the samples were positively skewed and negative skewed respectively, whereas, rest of the samples were symmetrical. All the beaches were dominated by mesokurtic sediment. Dominance of positively skewed sediment in the study area indicated the prevalence of low wave activity and longshore current. Presence of relatively high fraction of mesokurtic sediment indicated that the beaches along Kalpakkam by and large have uniform energy environment. © 2017, National Institute of Science Communication and Information Resources (NISCAIR).

Radon, thoron, and their progeny contribute more than 50 per cent to the annual effective dose due to natural radioactivity. South west coast of India is classified as a High Natural Background Radioactivity Area and large scale data on natural radioactivity and dosimetry are available from these coastal regions including the Neendakara-Chavara belt in the south of Kerala. However, similar studies and reports from the northern part of Kerala are scarce. The present study involves the data collection and analysis of radon, thoron, and progeny concentration in the Wayanad district of Kerala. The radon concentration was found to be within a range of 12-378 Bq/m3. The thoron concentration varied from 15 to 621 Bq/m3. Progeny concentration of radon and thoron and the diurnal variation of radon were also studied. In order to assess source term, wall and floor exhalation studies have been done for the houses showing elevated concentration of radon and thoron. The average values of radon, thoron, and their progeny are found to be above the Indian average as well as the average values reported from the High Natural Background Radioactivity Areas of Kerala.

      " 'Evaluation of plasma sprayed sacrificial thermal barrier coatings for core catcher of future Sodium cooled Fast ReactorsCore catcher is a passive safety device in nuclear reactors for collection and long term retention of corium (mixture of molten fuel and structural material) in subcritical and coolable geometry during hypothetical core melt accidents. Core catchers of earlier Sodium cooled Fast Reactors (SFR) were designed for partial core melt accidents. However in view of enhanced safety, the core catcher design for future SFR considers whole core melt scenario, which results in higher thermal and structural loads. Provision of a sacrificial layer is one of the methods to reduce the thermal load on core catcher and enhance its corium retention capability. An experimental study has been taken up to assess the compatibility of few candidate materials for sacrificial layer, with liquid sodium at high temperature conditions. Based on literature, alumina and Yttria Stabilized Zirconia (YSZ) are chosen due to their favorable properties like high melting point and lower thermal conductivity. Test specimen with Stainless Steel (AISI 316 LN, UNS No. S31653) substrate and candidate ceramic layer coated by plasma spray process, were prepared and exposed to sodium at 400 °C for 500 h. Post exposure investigations indicated that YSZ coating was leached out completely, whereas alumina coating was intact with the substrate. At low pressure, alumina had shown weak interaction with sodium i.e., formation of sodium aluminate within a shallow depth. However, at slightly higher pressure, delamination of coating was observed. The results indicated that plasma sprayed alumina and YSZ coatings are not stable in present test configuration. Alternate methods for sacrificial lining as well as materials need to be explored. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd'\n",
      " 'Performance evaluation of decay heat removal system of PFBR with partial availability of air side dampersDecay heat in PFBR is rejected to the atmosphere by the air flowing over the finned tube bundle of sodium to air heat exchangers which is part of the decay heat removal system of the reactor. Air flow over the tube bundle is driven by buoyancy forces generated by a chimney. Dampers with two louvers are provided in the air flow path at upstream and downstream of air heat exchanger to facilitate the heat removal through decay heat removal system on demand and minimise the loss of useful heat when the reactor is in normal operating condition. Experimental studies have been conducted to characterise the heat transport capability of the system when the air dampers are partially available. Hydraulic resistance of the finned tube bundle and air dampers were also evaluated for the operating conditions. From the studies it has been verified that the non-availability of one of the louvers in the two louver damper system is not affecting the heat transport capability of the decay heat removal system. It is also quantified that the hydraulic resistance offered by the finned tube bundle of air heat exchanger is 29% of the total hydraulic resistance of the air flow path. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.'\n",
      " 'Experiments in LEENA facility with modified wire type leak detector layout in large sodium pipelinesSodium cooled Fast Breeder Reactors (SFRs) are envisaged in the second phase of Indian nuclear power programme. Liquid sodium is used as the coolant in the SFRs due to its favourable nuclear properties and excellent heat transfer properties. Leaks in sodium systems have the potential of being exceptionally hazardous due to the reaction of liquid sodium with oxygen and water vapour in the air. When a sodium leak occurs, the sodium leak rate, the total quantity of sodium leaked and leak detector layout governs the detection time. Other factors to be considered are insulation material packing condition, distance between the leak point and detector, heater layout, pipe geometry, temperature etc. Potential regions of leakage in Fast Breeder Reactor (FBR) sodium circuits are near welds, high stress areas and regions subjected to thermal striping. Early detection of leak is needed for minimizing the quantity of sodium leaked to outside and consequent damages. Three wire type leak detectors (WLDs positioned at 90°, 180° and 270°) working on conductivity principle are used for detecting sodium leak in the large horizontal secondary sodium pipelines of Prototype Fast Breeder Reactor (PFBR). It was found from the upper boundary curve based on LEENA (LEak Experiments in NAtrium) facility experimental results with present PFBR leak detector layout, that a leak rate of 200 g/h and above can be detected within 6 h. To improve the detection capability, modified leak detector layout was proposed for FBR 800 NB size horizontal secondary circuit pipelines of FBR with seven WLDs positioned at 45°, 90°, 135°, 180°, 225°, 270° and 315° by taking top of pipeline as 0°. It is required to assess the performance of wire type leak detectors along with its layout on large horizontal sodium pipelines and confirm that they are meeting the requirements. LEENA facility was re-commissioned and five sodium leak experiments with modified leak detector layout on large horizontal pipeline were conducted with different sodium leak rates. From the experimental data it was observed that there was considerable reduction in detection time with modified WLD layout.

      " 'Evaluation of hydraulic characteristics of core flow monitoring mechanism for PFBRSodium flow through the fuel, blanket and storage subassemblies will be measured in Prototype Fast Breeder Reactor (PFBR) by the Core Flow Monitoring Mechanism (CFMM) during its commissioning. CFMM is planned to be placed on the top of the subassembly for the sodium flow measurement. This will monitor the flow allocation through different sub-assemblies and will infer flow blockage in subassembly if any. A portion of the sodium flowing through the subassembly will flow through the CFMM and the rest will flow through the lateral safety flow path provided at the subassembly top. The sodium flow through the CFMM will be measured by an eddy current flow sensor. For estimating the sodium flow through the subassembly from the measured sodium flow through CFMM, the hydraulic characteristics of the subassembly top portion and CFMM was established by experiments in water medium. It is estimated that 58.5% of the coolant flow passes through the CFMM for measuring sodium flow through fuel subassemblies and the rest passes through the lateral holes in the subassembly head. In case of measurement of flow through the blanket and storage subassemblies, 52% of the coolant passes through CFMM and the rest passes through the lateral holes. The data obtained from the water experiments were used to validate the numerical model of the same. This paper gives the details of the experimental and numerical studies carried out to characterize the core flow monitoring device for PFBR. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd'\n",
      " 'Implications of dynamic strain aging under LCF-HCF interactions in a type 316LN stainless steelInfluence of dynamic strain aging (DSA) under sequential low cycle fatigue (LCF) and high cycle fatigue (HCF) loading was investigated by conducting HCF tests on specimens subjected to prior LCF cycling over a wide range of temperature from 573 to 973 K. DSA was found to be pronounced at 823–873 K depending on the magnitude of the stress employed under HCF cycling. DSA was seen to have contrasting implications under LCF and HCF deformation resulting in an anomalous fatigue behavior in terms of remnant HCF life under LCF-HCF interaction. LCF-HCF interaction was found to be pronounced at intermediate levels of prior LCF exposure, where the remnant HCF life is dictated by competitive damage mechanism resulting from the influence of DSA under LCF as well as HCF. Detailed fracture surface examination revealed that extensive hardening associated with DSA leads to an extended zone of faceted appearance with river markings (Stage-I crack) under HCF cycling (with or without LCF exposure). This reduces the crack growth rate, delaying the transition of crack from Stage-I to Stage-II, thereby leading to an extension of life in such cases. On the other hand, a highly striated fracture surface indicating a quick transition in crack from Stage-I to Stage-II, was observed for loading conditions with minimal or no influence of DSA, thus leading to lower life compared to the previous case. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.'\n",

      " 'Development of ultrasonic glancing angle imaging methodology for detection of subassembly protrusion in fast breeder reactorsThe paper presents an ultrasonic glancing angle imaging based methodology developed for detection of protrusion and mapping of subassembly (SA) heads in a pool type liquid metal cooled fast breeder reactor. In the developed methodology, mapping of SA heads is performed by a single sweep of a transducer inclined at an oblique angle close to the horizontal plane. A large number of SAs is covered simultaneously due to divergence of the ultrasonic beam. A significant increase in the acoustic amplitude corresponding to the protruded SA and reduction in the amplitudes corresponding to the SAs in the shadow region can be used for detection of SA protrusion. Further, decrease in the time of flight of signal corresponding to the protruded SA can be used for quantitative estimation of the extent of SA protrusion. The present study demonstrates in water condition that ultrasonic glancing angle imaging methodology can be used for mapping of SA heads and to detect their protrusion, if any, without the need of placing an ultrasonic transducer just above the targeted SA. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.'\n",
      " 'Role of fields induced nanostructures, zippering and size polydispersity on effective thermal transport in magnetic fluids without significant viscosity enhancementMagnetic nanofluids or ferrofluids exhibit extraordinary field dependant tunable thermal conductivity (k), which make them potential candidates for microelectronic cooling applications. However, the associated viscosity enhancement under an external stimulus is undesirable for practical applications. Further, the exact mechanism of heat transport and the role of field induced nanostructures on thermal transport is not clearly understood. In this paper, through systematic thermal, rheological and microscopic studies in ‘model ferrofluids’, we demonstrate for the first time, the conditions to achieve very high thermal conductivity to viscosity ratio. Highly stable ferrofluids with similar crystallite size, base fluid, capping agent and magnetic properties, but with slightly different size distributions, are synthesized and characterized by X–ray diffraction, small angle X–ray scattering, transmission electron microscopy, dynamic light scattering, vibrating sample magnetometer, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and thermo–gravimetry. The average hydrodynamic diameters of the particles were 11.7 and 10.1 nm and the polydispersity indices (σ), were 0.226 and 0.151, respectively. We observe that the system with smaller polydispersity (σ = 0.151) gives larger k enhancement (130% for 150 G) as compared to the one with σ = 0.226 (73% for 80 G). Further, our results show that dispersions without larger aggregates and with high density interfacial capping (with surfactant) can provide very high enhancement in thermal conductivity, with insignificant viscosity enhancement, due to minimal interfacial losses. We also provide experimental evidence for the effective heat conduction (parallel mode) through a large number of space filling linear aggregates with high aspect ratio. Microscopic studies reveal that the larger particles act as nucleating sites and facilitate lateral aggregation (zippering) of linear chains that considerably reduces the number density of space filling linear aggregates. Our findings are very useful for optimizing the heat transfer properties of magnetic fluids (and also in composite systems consisting of CNT, graphene etc.) for the development of next generation microelectronic cooling technologies, thermal energy harvesting and magnetic fluid based therapeutics. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

      " 'Detection and evaluation of embedded mild steel can material into 18 Cr-oxide dispersion strengthened steel tubes by magnetic Barkhausen emissionThe paper presents a new methodology for detection and evaluation of mild steel (MS) can material embedded into oxide dispersion strengthened (ODS) steel tubes by magnetic Barkhausen emission (MBE) technique. The high frequency MBE measurements (125 Hz sweep frequency and 70–200 kHz analyzing frequency) are found to be very sensitive for detection of presence of MS on the surface of the ODS steel tube. However, due to a shallow depth of information from the high frequency MBE measurements, it cannot be used for evaluation of the thickness of the embedded MS. The low frequency MBE measurements (0.5 Hz sweep frequency and 2–20 kHz analyzing frequency) indicate presence of two MBE RMS voltage peaks corresponding to the MS and the ODS steel. The ratio of the two peaks changes with the thickness of the MS and hence, can be used for measurement of the thickness of the MS layer. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.'\n",

Sigma phase was synthesized from its parent alpha phase of Fe55Cr45 alloy by annealing at 973 K for 360 h in vacuum. A comparative thermal study of sigma and alpha phase alloy was performed from 373 to 1400 K by Differential Scanning Calorimeter. Single inflection of ferro to para magnetic transition (Tc) was observed in DSC upto melting at 831 K for alpha phase. For sigma phase, the sigma to alpha decomposition temperature was measured as 1122 K. It was observed that sigma phase decomposition temperature is nearly 30 K higher than the presently reported 1093 K. Kinetics study of sigma to alpha phase transformation has been carried out by employing various heating rates from 1 to 50 K min−1 in DSC. The non isothermal KJMA model has been adopted to model the fraction transformed to determine the order and kinetics parameters.

      " 'Low cycle fatigue behaviour of Grade 92 steel weld jointsIn the present study, low cycle fatigue (LCF) behaviour of tungsten (W) alloyed 9Cr steel (Grade 92 steel) base metal and its weld joints has been investigated. LCF tests on both base metal and weld joint were conducted under fully reversed, total axial strain control mode employing a triangular waveform at 823 K, under a constant strain rate of 3 × 10−3 s−1 with strain amplitudes varying from ±0.25% to ±1%. Both base metal and weld joint exhibited continuous softening with the weld joint exhibiting a lower stress response than base metal. At lower strain amplitudes, weld joint exhibited lower fatigue life than that of base metal whereas at higher strain amplitude, both the materials exhibited comparable fatigue life. Weld joints failed in the base metal for all the strain amplitudes at 823 K except at the strain amplitude ±0.25% where weld joint failed in inter-critical region. Effect of temperature on LCF behaviour of weld joints and base metal at various temperatures ranging from 300 K to 873 K under constant strain amplitude of ±0.6% and strain rate 3 × 10−3 has been investigated. At all the temperatures, weld joints failed in the base metal region. The material exhibited dynamic strain ageing phenomenon in the temperature range 473–673 K.

      " 'Assessment of Stress Corrosion Cracking Resistance of Activated Tungsten Inert Gas-Welded Duplex Stainless Steel JointsThe stress corrosion cracking behavior of duplex stainless steel (DSS) weld joint largely depends on the ferrite-austenite phase microstructure balance. This phase balance is decided by the welding process used, heat input, welding conditions and the weld metal chemistry.

Boiling magnesium chloride (45\\xa0wt.%) environment maintained at 155\\xa0°C was used. The microstructure and ferrite content of different weld zones are correlated with the outcome of sustained load, SCC test. Irrespective of the welding processes used, SCC resistance of weld joints was inferior to that of the base metal. However, ATIG weld joint exhibited superior resistance to SCC than the TIG weld joint. The crack initiation and final failure were in the weld metal for the ATIG weld joint; they were in the heat-affected zone for the TIG weld joint. © 2017, ASM International.'\n",

X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns are analyzed using three different models. The dislocation densities are determined employing the Convolution Multiple Whole Profile (CMWP) fitting, the analysis of the asymptotic part of the X-ray line profile (Groma's method), and the Rietveld refinement coupling Popa's and Williamson-Smallman approaches. CMWP method is used to measure the internal dislocation density inside the subgrains consisting of mobile and dipole dislocations, and the results show good agreement with Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) measurements. Groma's method is used to evaluate the total dislocation density, with results comparable to those obtained from the combination of Electron Backscatter Diffraction (EBSD) and TEM. Rietveld method gives the internal dislocation density or mobile dislocation density depending on the model chosen.

The sensitized specimens were pulsed polarized so that only Cr-depleted regions of the sensitized grain boundaries contributed to the electrochemical noise (EN) study. The DOS values evaluated from DLEPR technique were correlated with the EN parameters viz. standard deviation of current, σI and characteristic charge, q and characteristic frequency, fn, obtained from shot noise analysis in order to assess the extent of intergranular corrosion (IGC) attack in 316LN SS. The plot of σI versus time showed highest σI values for the specimen sensitized at 923\\xa0K for 500\\xa0h, indicating high grain boundary dissolution and hence, severe IGC attack, whereas the specimen sensitized at 898\\xa0K for 500\\xa0h showed the least σI values indicating lower dissolution and least IGC attack. 316LN SS specimen heat-treated at 948\\xa0K for 500\\xa0h showed intermediate grain boundary dissolution rate.

      " 'Magnetic hyperthermia in magnetic nanoemulsions: Effects of polydispersity, particle concentration and medium viscosityMagnetic fluid hyperthermia (MFH) is a promising cancer treatment modality where alternating magnetic field is used for heating cancerous cells loaded with magnetic nanofluids. Of late, it is realized that magnetic nano-carriers in the size range ∼100–200\\xa0nm (e.g. magnetic nanocomposites, magnetic liposomes and magnetic nanoemulsions) are ideal candidates for multimodal MFH coupled with drug delivery or photodynamic therapy due to enhanced permeation and retention (EPR) in the leaky vasculature of cancerous tissues. Here, we study the radiofrequency alternating magnetic field induced heating in magnetically polarizable oil-in-water nanoemulsions of hydrodynamic diameter ∼200\\xa0nm, containing single domain superparamagnetic nanoparticles of average diameter ∼10\\xa0nm in the oil phase. We probe the effects of size polydispersity of the droplets and medium viscosity on the field induced heating efficiency. The contribution of Neel and Brown relaxation of the magnetic nanoparticles on specific absorption rate (SAR) of the magnetic nanoemulsions, was found to increase linearly with the square of the applied field, with a maximum value of 164.4\\xa0±\\xa04.3\\xa0W/gFe. In magnetic nanoemulsions, the heating is induced by the Neel-Brown relaxation of the MNP over a length scale of 10\\xa0nm, and the whole scale Brownian relaxation of the emulsion droplets has over a length scale of 200\\xa0nm. The magnetic nanoemulsion sample with lower polydispersity (σ\\xa0=\\xa00.2) exhibited a significantly higher SAR value (3.3 times higher) as compared to the sample with larger polydispersity (σ\\xa0=\\xa00.4). The SAR values of the samples with 4.6 and 1.7 wt.% of MNP loading with σ values 0.4 a 0.3, respectively were comparable, suggesting a higher heating efficiency in nanofluid containing particles of lower size polydispersity even at lower particle loading. The emulsion droplets, immobilized in an agar matrix (4\\xa0wt.%), gave a maximum SAR value of 41.7\\xa0±\\xa02.4\\xa0W/gFe as compared to 111.8\\xa0±\\xa03.4\\xa0W/gFe in the case of droplets dispersed in water, which indicate a ∼40–50% drop in SAR due to abrogation of whole scale Brownian relaxation of the emulsion droplets. This suggests the need for improving the heating efficiency during actual therapy in tissues. The residual SAR of the immobilized sample correlates well with the SAR of the magnetic nanofluid, albeit under a lower external field amplitude due to demagnetization effect of the clusters of MNP loaded inside the droplets. The observed heating efficiency of larger sized magnetic nanoemulsion offer new possibilities for multimodal therapy due to availability of large volume for loading anti-cancer drug or photodynamic agents. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.'\n",

Towards this, two ceramic coatings were investigated for its application as a layer of sacrificial material on the top of core catcher to enhance its capability. Plasma-sprayed thermal barrier layer of alumina and partially stabilised zirconia (PSZ) with an intermediate bond coat of NiCrAlY are selected as candidate material and deposited over 316LN SS substrates and were tested for their suitability as thermal barrier layer for core catcher.

Towards this goal, a series of diffusion couple experiments have been conducted at three different temperatures namely, 600, 700 and 800 °C for time durations up to 5000 h. The thickness of interaction layer has been monitored using standard metallographic procedures. The experiments revealed that ferroboron/P91 combination exhibited a tendency to form complex intermetallic borides at the interface. The structural and microstructural characterization of the interface confirmed that the reaction layer consists predominantly of borides of Fe and Cr of type FeB, Fe2B, (Fe,Cr)2B and (Fe,Cr)B. The measured variation of interaction layer thickness as a function of time and temperature have been modelled in terms of diffusion mediated interaction. The growth kinetics of borided layer has followed the parabolic law at each temperature, and the apparent activation energy for boride layer formation is found to be of the order of 115 kJ mol−1. This indicates that the kinetics of boriding could be governed by diffusion of B into the P91 matrix. Based on the findings of present study, an extrapolative estimate of the clad attack thickness at 550 °C for 60 years of operating time has been made and it turns out to be 210 ± 15 μm, which is less than the clad thickness of FBR shielding subassembly (4 mm) [1]. Thus, this study confirms that at testing temperatures from 550 to 600 °C, the ferroboron/P91 steel combination can be safely employed for shielding subassembly applications in fast reactors. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.'\n",

The paper explores discrete features that emerge in selected area diffraction patterns of quenched Ti-15wt%Mo alloy and analyzes the correlation between ω reflections and diffuse arcs by considering all variants of ω phase as per the formation kinetics of ω phase in β matrix while quenching. Superimposed simulated diffraction patterns have been compared with experimental counterparts and it is deduced that there is lack of congruence between ω reflections and diffuse arcs even after considering trigonal ω with varying degrees of displacement. Direct lattice imaging of trigonal ω in β matrix has been demonstrated by phase contrast microscopy coupled with Fourier filtering techniques. By investigating the nature of ω reflections and diffuse arcs with the aid of electron diffraction pattern calculations and phase contrast microscopy, it is shown that, existing model of three-dimensional (3D) reciprocal space of ω forming alloy at quenched stage is not complete.

The test parameters have been selected based on operational conditions prevailing in the Indian sodium cooled fast breeder reactors (FBRs). Accordingly, the tests were carried out at sliding speeds of 2 and 16 mm/s under contact stresses of 10 and 40 MPa respectively using Ni-Cr-B coated pin and disc specimens. The static and dynamic friction coefficients are found to be in the ranges of 0.03–0.07 and 0.01–0.02 respectively under the imposed test conditions. The estimated wear rates (WR) are found to be in the range of 0.62 × 10−12 − 3.07 × 10−12 m3/m; the magnitude of WR increases with increase in the contact stress. The examination of the worn disc specimens by confocal laser scanning microscopy indicated higher damage in specimens tested at 40 MPa compared to that in specimens tested at 10 MPa; the quantitative estimation of damage was made by the number of scars and their depth. These observations corroborate well with the morphological features of the worn surfaces of the pin specimens examined by scanning electron microscopy. The results unambiguously indicate superior friction coefficients and wear resistance of Ni-Cr-B coatings in liquid sodium compared to that in air under identical test conditions. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.'\n",

      " 'Uncertainties in the estimation of specific absorption rate during radiofrequency alternating magnetic field induced non-adiabatic heating of ferrofluidsMagnetic fluid hyperthermia (MFH) is becoming a viable cancer treatment methodology where the alternating magnetic field induced heating of magnetic fluid is utilized for ablating the cancerous cells or making them more susceptible to the conventional treatments. The heating efficiency in MFH is quantified in terms of specific absorption rate (SAR), which is defined as the heating power generated per unit mass. In majority of the experimental studies, SAR is evaluated from the temperature rise curves, obtained under non-adiabatic experimental conditions, which is prone to various thermodynamic uncertainties. A proper understanding of the experimental uncertainties and its remedies is a prerequisite for obtaining accurate and reproducible SAR. Here, we study the thermodynamic uncertainties associated with peripheral heating, delayed heating, heat loss from the sample and spatial variation in the temperature profile within the sample. Using first order approximations, an adiabatic reconstruction protocol for the measured temperature rise curves is developed for SAR estimation, which is found to be in good agreement with those obtained from the computationally intense slope corrected method. Our experimental findings clearly show that the peripheral and delayed heating are due to radiation heat transfer from the heating coils and slower response time of the sensor, respectively. Our results suggest that the peripheral heating is linearly proportional to the sample area to volume ratio and coil temperature. It is also observed that peripheral heating decreases in presence of a non-magnetic insulating shielding. The delayed heating is found to contribute up to ∼25% uncertainties in SAR values. As the SAR values are very sensitive to the initial slope determination method, explicit mention of the range of linear regression analysis is appropriate to reproduce the results. The effect of sample volume to area ratio on linear heat loss rate is systematically studied and the results are compared using a lumped system thermal model. The various uncertainties involved in SAR estimation are categorized as material uncertainties, thermodynamic uncertainties and parametric uncertainties. The adiabatic reconstruction is found to decrease the uncertainties in SAR measurement by approximately three times. Additionally, a set of experimental guidelines for accurate SAR estimation using adiabatic reconstruction protocol is also recommended. These results warrant a universal experimental and data analysis protocol for SAR measurements during field induced heating of magnetic fluids under non-adiabatic conditions. © 2017 IOP Publishing Ltd.'\n",

Due to its simplicity and efficiency, DA has received interest of researchers from different fields. However, it lacks internal memory which may lead to its premature convergence to local optima. To overcome this drawback, we propose a novel Memory based Hybrid Dragonfly Algorithm (MHDA) for solving numerical optimization problems. The pbest and gbest concept of Particle Swarm optimization (PSO) is added to conventional DA to guide the search process for potential candidate solutions and PSO is then initialized with pbest of DA to further exploit the search space. The proposed method combines the exploration capability of DA and exploitation capability of PSO to achieve global optimal solutions. The efficiency of the MHDA is validated by testing on basic unconstrained benchmark functions and CEC 2014 test functions. A comparative performance analysis between MHDA and other powerful optimization algorithms have been carried out and significance of the results is proved by statistical methods. The results show that MHDA gives better performance than conventional DA and PSO. Moreover, it gives competitive results in terms of convergence, accuracy and search-ability when compared with the state-of-the-art algorithms. The efficacy of MHDA in solving real world problems is also explained with three engineering design problems. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd'\n",
      " 'Size dependent deformation behaviour and dislocation mechanisms in 〈1\\xa00\\xa00〉 Cu nanowiresMolecular dynamics simulations have been performed to understand the size-dependent tensile deformation behaviour of 〈1\\xa00\\xa00〉 Cu nanowires at 10\\xa0K. The influence of nanowire size has been examined by varying square cross-section width (d) from 0.723 to 43.38\\xa0nm using constant length of 21.69\\xa0nm. The results indicated that the yielding in all the nanowires occurs through nucleation of partial dislocations. Following yielding, the plastic deformation in small size nanowires occurs mainly by slip of partial dislocations at all strains, while in large size nanowires, slip of extended dislocations has\\xa0been observed at high strains in addition to slip of partial dislocations. Further, the variations in dislocation density indicated that the nanowires with d\\xa0>\\xa03.615\\xa0nm exhibit dislocation exhaustion at small strains followed by dislocation starvation at high strains. On the other hand, small size nanowires with d\\xa0<\\xa03.615\\xa0nm displayed mainly dislocation starvation at all strains. The average length of dislocations has been found to be same and nearly constant in all the nanowires. Both the Young’s modulus and yield strength exhibited a rapid decrease at small size nanowires followed by gradual decrease to saturation at larger size. The observed linear increase in ductility with size has been correlated with the pre- and post-necking deformation. Finally, dislocation–dislocation interactions leading to the formation of various dislocation locks, the dislocation–stacking fault interactions resulting in the annihilation of stacking faults and the size dependence of dislocation–surface interactions have been discussed. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor and Francis Group.'\n",
      " 'Double reorientation in 1 1 Cu nanowiresMolecular dynamics simulations performed on tensile deformation of\\xa0〈1 1 0〉\\xa0Cu nanowire indicated that the nanowire undergoes double reorientation from 〈1 1 0〉 to 〈1 0 0〉 tensile axis followed by 〈1 0 0〉 to 〈1 1 2〉 tensile axis. It has been observed that the double reorientation results from the occurrence of twinning mode of deformation in both the original 〈1 1 0〉 and reoriented 〈1 0 0〉 Cu nanowires. The double reorientation in 〈1 1 0〉 Cu nanowire leads to tensile ductility as high as 260% thereby displaying superplastic like behaviour. The occurrence of double reorientation and the associated high tensile ductility have been restricted to low nanowire length below or equal to 7.15\\xa0nm with aspect ratio\\xa0≤1. Above this length (higher aspect ratio), the reorientation process has not been observed and the nanowire fails at significantly lower strains due to activation of multiple twin systems facilitating twin–twin interactions. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor and Francis Group.'\n",
      " 'Thermomechanical fatigue behavior of nitrogen enhanced 316LN stainless steel: Effect of cyclic strainThermomechanical fatigue (TMF) behavior of nitrogen enhanced 316LN stainless steel (with 0.14\\xa0wt.% N) is investigated under in-phase (IP) and out-of-phase (OP) conditions at cyclic strain amplitudes of ±0.25 to ±0.8% and with a temperature interval of 623–873\\xa0K. The study elucidates the differences in cyclic stress-strain response, TMF lives and fracture behavior of the material under IP and OP-TMF in the light of dynamic strain aging, thermal recovery and creep. The manifestations of these factors/phenomena are found to vary along stress-strain hysteresis loops, thereby leading to differences in cyclic strain hardening exponent (n′) and coefficient (K′) between the tensile and compressive branches of hysteresis loops. Irrespective of the imposed cyclic strain, transgranular fatigue failure is observed under OP-cycling in contrast to mixed-mode fracture under IP-cycling. The IP-cycling led to considerably lower cyclic life (i.e. 34–49%) compared to those under OP-TMF, with the life reduction being more significant (∼48.5%) at intermediate mechanical strain amplitudes of ±0.4 and ±0.6%. A comparison of the fatigue design curves under TMF with the corresponding isothermal fatigue curves (as per the RCC-MR design code) revealed a lack of conservatism in the latter. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd'\n",

The specimens were passivated at 0.0\\xa0V(SCE) for 1\\xa0h in 3 and 8\\xa0M sodium hydroxide solutions at RT as well as in boiling condition. Laser Raman spectroscopic (LRS) analysis was carried out to examine the nature of oxides/hydroxides formed on the surface of the specimens. Corrosion rates increased by one order of magnitude whereas passive current density increased by almost two orders of magnitude in boiling solution compared to the RT values. Appearance of only maghemite (γ-Fe2O3) peaks in passivated steel in 3\\xa0M sodium hydroxide solution at RT compared to that in the 8\\xa0M sodium hydroxide solution, which showed Fe(OH)2, maghemite, magnetite, goethite (α-FeOOH) and CrO(OH), Cr2O3 peaks, indicated corrosion attack on the outer layer of the passive film. The passivated steel specimens in 3 and 8\\xa0M boiling solutions showed maghemite, magnetite, goethite, hematite (α-Fe2O3) (only in 8\\xa0M) and extremely weak peaks of Cr(OH)3 and Cr2O5. These observations indicated dissolution of the outermost part of the passive film with superficial attack on the inner part of the passive film exposing Cr oxide/hydroxides in boiling 3\\xa0M solution. However, passivated steel in 8\\xa0M solution showed molybdenum oxides, apart from the other iron and chromium oxides/oxyhydroxides. The scanning electron microscopic (SEM) studies on the morphology of the corrosion products along with LRS analysis/characterization confirmed these observations.

      " 'Comparative assessment of remnant tensile properties of modified 9Cr-1Mo steel under prior low cycle fatigue and creep-fatigue interaction loadingProgressive deterioration in the mechanical properties with increasing service period is commonly observed and hence needs to be addressed. Awareness about the rate of degradation of the properties can circumvent a lot of problems faced during service. Hence the present work aims to understand the degradation of tensile properties due to prior cyclic loading. Systematic comparative evaluation study for the evolution of tensile properties with prior fatigue loading and the deformation and damage evolution process in modified 9Cr-1Mo steel during low cycle fatigue (LCF) and creep-fatigue interaction (CFI) loadings has been carried out. For this, LCF and CFI experiments were carried out at constant strain amplitude of ±0.6%, strain rate of 3\\xa0×\\xa010−3\\xa0s−1 and temperature of 600\\xa0°C. Experiments interrupted after 5, 10, 30, and 50% of the total fatigue life (Nf) under both LCF and CFI conditions were followed by monotonic loading at the same strain rate and temperature until fracture. Drastic reduction in the yield strength value due to both LCF and CFI prior fatigue loading was revealed and the extent of decrease in the YS values increased with the extent of prior fatigue damage imparted on the steel. Substantial difference in the YS evolution with prior fatigue damage under LCF and CFI conditions occurred only after 10% life fraction due to the predominance of creep recovery process. Factors such as microstructural changes due to creep alone or fatigue alone or both and surface oxidation changed the tensile properties under LCF and CFI. © 2017'\n",

The predicted phase composition as a function of temperature obtained using JMatPro® software was confirmed in conjunction with the microstructural evolution characterized by scanning and transmission electron microscopy. Microstructures revealed primary Nb(C,N), M23C6 precipitates at γ-grain boundaries, fine secondary Nb(C,N) intragranular carbides, and a uniform precipitation of andlt;40-nm-sized spherical Cu-rich phase after thermal aging for 10,000\\xa0hours at 903\\xa0K (630\\xa0°C).

      " \"Molecular dynamics simulation studies on the influence of aspect ratio on tensile deformation and failure behaviour of 〈1\\xa00\\xa00〉 copper nanowiresMolecular dynamics (MD) simulations have been performed to understand the influence of aspect ratio on tensile deformation and failure behaviour of 〈1\\xa00\\xa00〉 Cu nanowires with square cross-section at 10\\xa0K. In the present investigation, the aspect ratio (defined as nanowire length to cross-section width ratio) was varied from 0.5 to 30 in two different ways. In the first instance, cross-section width was varied from 43.4 to 0.72\\xa0nm for constant nanowire length of 21.69\\xa0nm, while in other, nanowire length was varied from 3.61 to 216.9\\xa0nm for constant cross-section width of 7.23\\xa0nm. The simulation results indicated that the Young's modulus and yield strength have been sensitive mainly to nanowire cross-section width and remains independent of nanowire length. Irrespective of varying length or cross-section width, all the nanowires deformed by the slip of 1/6〈1\\xa01\\xa02〉 partial dislocations and failed in ductile manner. Strain to failure (ductility) has been sensitive to both the nanowire length and cross-section width. The variations in tensile ductility with aspect ratio exhibited a rapid decrease at low aspect ratio followed by saturation at high aspect ratio. In the case of nanowires with varying cross-section width, high ductility at low aspect ratio arises mainly from high pre- and post-necking deformation. On the other hand, significantly higher post-necking deformation contributes to high ductility at low aspect ratio in nanowires with varying length. © 2017\"\n",
      " 'Corrosion behavior and surface film characterization of TaNbHfZrTi high entropy alloy in aggressive nitric acid mediumCorrosion behavior of TaNbHfZrTi high-entropy alloy (HEA) was investigated in nitric and fluorinated nitric acid at ambient (27 °C) and boiling (120 °C) conditions. The alloy passivated spontaneously during potentiodynamic polarization in 11.5 M HNO3 at ambient condition. The corrosion rate was negligible in boiling 11.5 M HNO3, exposed for 240 h. Scanning electron microscopic (SEM) studies did not show any significant corrosion attack. The high corrosion resistance of TaNbHfZrTi HEA was attributed to its single phase bcc structure. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopic (XPS) analysis revealed that the protective passive film formed in boiling nitric acid was predominantly composed of Ta2O5, in contrast to the presence of ZrO2 and HfO2 in air-formed native film. Potentiodynamic polarization studies indicated a pseudo-passivation behavior of the HEA in 11.5 M HNO3 + 0.05 M NaF at ambient condition. In boiling fluorinated nitric acid, SEM images of TaNbHfZrTi HEA displayed a severely corroded morphology indicating the instability of the metal-oxides of the alloying elements. XPS investigations confirmed the presence of ZrF4, ZrOF2 and HfF4 along with un-protective oxides of Ta, Nb and Ti on the film, resulting in decreased corrosion resistance of TaNbHfZrTi HEA in fluorinated nitric acid. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd'\n",
      " 'Evolution of damage under combined low and high cycle fatigue loading in a type 316LN stainless steel at different temperaturesThe present study investigates the effect of different damage modes like low cycle fatigue (LCF), high cycle fatigue (HCF), creep and ratcheting during combined cycling at various temperatures ranging from ambient to 923\\xa0K, in a type 316LN austenitic stainless steel. The experiments were designed with multi-step load sequences where specific number of small amplitude HCF cycles (referred to as blocks) were introduced at the stabilized cyclic load under LCF for a given strain amplitude and repeated until failure. Cyclic life was found to decrease with increase in temperature as well as block-size. The decrease in cyclic life with block-size is more significant at 923\\xa0K where multiple damage modes like creep and ratcheting are activated. Dynamic strain aging (DSA) was found to operate in the temperature range, 823–873\\xa0K where the decrease in cyclic life with block-size gets saturated. Typically, transgranular fatigue fracture, intergranular creep fracture or dimpled rupture was identified when failure was dictated by LCF, creep and ratcheting respectively. However, synergistic interaction between the above damage modes leading to a mixed mode fracture carrying signatures of fatigue striations, intergranular facets and dimples occurred at specific combinations of block size and temperature. HCF damage played an important role for some specific loading conditions by acting as a link between intergranular (creep) cracks, thus facilitating the crack propagation and final failure. The regimes of dominant failure modes and interactions among them were suitably mapped as a function of temperature and block size. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd'\n",

The tempered martensite microstructure obtained through DNT treatment exhibited smaller sizes of prior-austenite grains/martensite packets (28 μm/11 μm) compared to the CNT treatment (44 μm/14 μm). The tempered martensite morphology was largely retained after long-term thermal aging at 550 °C/5000 h, while the M23C6 and M2(C,N) type of precipitates were found to act as nucleation sites for precipitation of brittle Fe2Mo Laves phase. The grain refinement by DNT was found to be beneficial for minimizing the ductile-to-brittle transition characteristics (25 °C lower ductile-to-brittle transition temperature and 70 J higher upper shelf energy) over the CNT. Thermal embrittlement occurred in both heated treated steels, but the transition temperature of aged DNT steel remained below room temperature. Fractured Charpy specimens revealed ductile failure by void coalescence for high temperature tests, and a quasi-cleavage fracture at low temperatures with few isolated occurrence of intergranular crack in thermal embrittled steel. The DNT treated steel resulted in similar or better tensile and creep properties, when compared to the CNT treatment. The homogeneous fine grained tempered martensite microstructure obtained by DNT treatment resulted in improved embrittlement resistance and mechanical properties over the conventional treatment. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.'\n",

The formation of FeO phase from Fe and Fe3O4 is identified through Differential Scanning Calorimetry and confirmed using Synchrotron Diffraction and Transmission Electron Microscopy. Qualitative X-ray phase analysis showed the stoichiometry of the FeO phase as Fe0.87O. This phase is expected to be beneficial as it offers strengthening in the Fe matrix and is thermally stable. The activation energy of formation of the Fe0.87O phase was estimated to be ~ 195 kJ mol− 1. This phase is also found to be partially stabilizing the cubic phase of ZrO2, at high temperatures. A cubic ⇆ tetragonal transformation of ZrO2 was identified at 1140 K. A rather broad peak was observed for Fe α → γ transformation in the Calorimetry thermograms as the Fe grains were nanocrystalline which became sharper as the crystallites grew in size. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.'\n",

The weld region was examined by X-ray radiography for defect detection. LSM of 304L SS weldment was performed using Nd:YAG pulsed laser. Microstructural evaluation was carried out using optical and electron back scatter diffraction techniques. The microstructure of 304L SS base was found to be austenitic, while the weld region of 304L SS weldment contained delta ferrite distributed in austenite matrix. The microstructure of LSM 304L SS weldment was found to be homogeneous austenite matrix with sparsely distributed ferrite. Ferrite measurements showed a decrease in the percentage ferrite in the fusion zone of 304L SS weldment after LSM. A profound enhancement in the pitting corrosion resistance was observed after LSM, which could be attributed to the homogeneous microstructure and decrease in the ferrite content. Pit density was found to be higher in the heat-affected zone of the weldment. Very few pits were observed in the LSM 304L SS weldment compared to the as-weldment. © 2017, The Minerals, Metals and Materials Society and ASM International.'\n",

The presence of pores, lamellae boundaries, and other non-fillings dampens the insulation resistance of the coating. In the present study, aluminum phosphate was used to seal the surface of plasma-sprayed alumina coating and evaluate the effect of sealing on the insulation resistance and its thermal cycling response. Sealing was carried out with three concentrations of sealant (P/Al molar ratio of 3, 10, and 15). Characterization by X-ray diffraction and scanning electron microscopy revealed the primary sealing phase as aluminum metaphosphate and effective sealing of the pores by the aluminum phosphate phases. Insulation resistance is improved by two orders of magnitude after sealing the coated samples. Sealing with P/Al molar ratio 3 exhibited maximum insulation resistance of ∼1013 Ω at room temperature.

The simulations have been carried out at different temperatures in the range 10-1000 K employing a constant strain rate of 1 × 108 s-1. The results indicate that at low temperatures (10-375 K), the nanowires yield through the nucleation of a sharp crack and fails in brittle manner. On the other hand, nucleation of multiple 1/2{111} dislocations at yielding followed by significant plastic deformation leading to ductile failure has been observed at high temperatures in the range 450-1000 K. At 400 K, the nanowire yields through nucleation of crack associated with many mobile 1/2{111} and immobile {100} dislocations at the crack tip and fails in ductile manner. The ductile-brittle transition observed in {111} BCC Fe nanowires is appropriately reflected in the stress-strain behavior and plastic strain at failure. The ductile-brittle transition increases with increasing nanowire size. The change in fracture behavior has been discussed in terms of the relative variations in yield and fracture stresses and change in slip behavior with respect to temperature. Further, the dislocation multiplication mechanism assisted by the kink nucleation from the nanowire surface observed at high temperatures has been presented. © 2017 Author(s).'\n",

From the analysis of flow behavior, it is observed that the nitrogen enhanced steel, in its hot working domain exhibits strain and strain rate hardening with thermal softening. The flow behavior analysis also demonstrates the coupled effect of strain–temperature and strain rate temperature on the flow stress. To depict the flow behavior of the material, strain compensated Arrhenius (SCA) equation and Model D8A have been used. The SCA predicts the flow curves with an average absolute error of 9.27% and a correlation coefficient of 0.977, whereas the prediction by Model D8A gives the average absolute relative error as 10.86% with a correlation coefficient of 0.966. For high temperature and intermediate strain rate, both Model D8A and SCA equation depict the flow behavior of 316L (0.14)N SS with good correlation and generalization. However, at low temperature and high strain rate domain, both the models are unable to depict the behavior; this is attributed to the fact that the material shows two slope behaviors where the constants have been calculated assuming a linear relationship between stress and strain rate. © 2016, The Indian Institute of Metals - IIM.'\n",

The main objective of this study is to identify corrosive bacterial strains from crude oil reservoir samples and elucidation of their role in the biocorrosion of carbon steel API 5LX. Pure bacterial strains were identified using both biochemical and 16S rRNA gene sequencing methods. Identified dominant strains were subjected to weight loss and electrochemical studies.

Surface analysis techniques including X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy and atomic force microscopy examination reveal the ability of bacteria to oxidize iron/manganese to their corresponding oxides, leading to the formation of thick biofilm on metal surface and accelerating the pitting corrosion of carbon steel. © 2017, Springer International Publishing Switzerland.'\n",
      " 'Anisotropic diffusion based denoising on X-radiography images to detect weld defectsThis paper proposes a machine vision scheme for denoising, feature space gradient preserving, and detecting weld defects in noisy weld X-radiography images; particularly, for the images that are in low-contrast and contain noises. The detection of small weld defects present on noisy image is extremely difficult in non-destructive testing through machine vision. The presence of high gradient magnitude and the low intensity in the feature space of a noisy image are the main characteristics of weld defects. These characteristics can be considered to refine and obtain noise-free images for detection of weld defects. This study proposes a modified anisotropic diffusion model, which considers a local probability value of gray-level and an adaptive threshold parameter in diffusion coefficient function to adjust the implication of low edge gradient of the feature space from the noisy image. Furthermore, an entropy based stopping criterion has been introduced to terminate the diffusion process. This proposed model is compared with the existing models, and its performance is evaluated through Mean Square Error (MSE), Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR), Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR), Entropy (E) and Mean Structural Similarity (MSSIM) measures. Experimental results confirm the reliability of the proposed model. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.'\n",
      " 'Improving the lubricating properties of 10W40 oil using oxidized graphite additivesImproving the tribological properties of mineral oils is necessary for energy conservation and enhancing machine efficiency. The antifriction and antiwear properties of 10W40 oil were significantly improved by the addition of small amounts of oxidized graphite flakes. According to the X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), this improvement was related to the oxidation of ultrasonicated graphite flakes in an ambient atmosphere accompanied by the adsorption of oxygenated compounds. The oxidation induces the defects which modify the chemical structure in an sp2 graphite lattice. The dispersion stability of graphite flakes increased in 10W40 oil due to their structural defects and adsorbed oxygen functional groups. This was found to be the main reason behind the improvement of the lubricating properties of graphite flake additives. The formation of transfer films of the graphite structure on the sliding interfaces was shown by the micro-Raman spectroscopy, which explained the improvement of the antifriction and antiwear properties of the mixture by the mechanical reasons. © 2017, Allerton Press, Inc.'\n",

In the flowing sodium environment, the steel exhibited better creep deformation and rupture strength than those in air environment. The onset of tertiary stage of creep deformation has delayed in sodium environment over that in air environment, which led to the decrease in minimum creep rate. Also the rate of tertiary creep strain accumulation was lower in sodium environment than that in air, leading to the increase in rupture life. The steel failed in ductile dimple fracture mode in both the testing environments. The steel exhibits relatively higher creep damage tolerance in sodium environment than in the air environment. Minimal oxidation was observed in the specimens creep tested in sodium environment.

Under such loading conditions, a critical damage marking the strongest LCF-HCF interaction was found to occur at specific pre-exposures of LCF depending inversely on the strain amplitude employed. Fracture surface examination of specimens failed in HCF with prior exposure in LCF showed formation of isolated striation pockets as the main manifestation of LCF-HCF interaction. Detailed Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) analysis revealed extensive formation of microtwins as prominent microstructural manifestations of LCF-HCF interaction. All these features appear within the window of effective LCF-HCF interaction and hence are a strong function of the applied strain amplitude as well as the degree of prior LCF exposure. It was found out that even though formation of major crack (critical damage) is a pre-requisite for microtwins to appear, there are several microscopic factors associated to the formation of such twins, which were discussed in detail. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.'\n",
      " 'New insights to damage initiation during creep deformation of stainless steel weld jointsA systematic investigation has been carried out to asses the creep cavitation behaviour in austenitic stainless steel fusion zone by performing detailed microstructural and finite element analysis. Metallographic observations of the failed cross-weld joint specimens reveal that the cavities nucleated in the near-crown region and propagated towards the near-root region. Similar pattern of nucleation and growth of cavities was observed in weld joint tested at a different stress level. The preferential nucleation of creep cavities in the near-crown region of the weld joint can be attributed to both micro and macro inhomogeneities in the weld joint. The micro-inhomogeneity in the fusion zone, which could be characterized using electron backscatter diffraction studies, is a result of variations in morphology and formation of thermo-mechanically treated region across the weld pass interface. The considerable strength variation between the heat affected zone, base metal and fusion zone resulted in macro-inhomogeneity in the weld joint and introduced significant stress gradients which could be illustrated using finite element analysis. Both micro and macro-inhomogeneities have a synergistic role in determining the damage initiation location in multi-pass stainless steel weld joints subjected to creep. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.'\n",

Grazing incidence X-ray diffraction (GIXRD) patterns revealed the scales to be enriched with haematite and less intense magnetite peaks. Detailed XPS characterization indicated the presence of mixed oxides of iron (Fe), chromium (Cr) and manganese (Mn) in the oxide scales. The Fe–Cr spinel in the oxide scale offered resistance to oxidation of the steel, whereas Mn–Cr spinel was deleterious in nature as it promoted cracking and formation of blisters. © 2016, The Indian Institute of Metals - IIM.'\n",
      " 'A Thermodynamic Framework Bridging the Composition and Temperature Dependence of Bulk Modulus With Enthalpy of MixingThe intrinsic thermodynamic links that exist between thermochemical and thermophysical quantities, especially their temperature, pressure, and composition dependence, have seldom been analyzed in sufficient detail in literature. In this connection, an attempt is made to establish a thermodynamic bridge, relating ΔoHmix, the standard enthalpy of mixing with ΔoBT, the change in isothermal bulk modulus as a result of alloying and its composition and temperature dependence. In essence, by adopting the standard regular and subregular solution approximations to the composition dependence of mixing enthalpy; and furthermore, incorporating separately the configurational (ΔoSconf) and vibrational (ΔoSVib) entropy contributions to mixing Gibbs energy change (ΔoGmix), simple models have been derived for the composition and temperature variations of excess bulk modulus ΔBT. In particular, a regular or subregular solution analog of the composition variation of ΔBT is shown to be possible if ΔoHmix could be described likewise. The vibrational entropy contribution to ΔBT is found to be important only when the change in Grüneisen parameter during alloying turns to be significant. The practical utility of the theoretical framework developed in this study has been demonstrated by applying it to disordered fcc Cu1−xNix alloys, wherein it is shown that ΔoHmix and ΔoBT are linearly correlated, as predicted by the theory. © 2017, The Minerals, Metals and Materials Society and ASM International.'\n",

The kinetics of evolution of secondary phases like M23C6, MX, and Laves phase crucially depend upon the W and Ta content of the steel in addition to temperature and time, which has been studied in detail using analytical transmission electron microscopy as well as predictive methods. The steel with 1 wt pct W and 0.06 wt pct Ta showed slow recovery below 873 K (600 °C) and no evidence for Laves phase at any temperature. Significant change in microstructure was observed after 10,000 hours of exposure at 923\\xa0K (650\\xa0°C), while recovery at short durations was retarded by nucleation of MX precipitates.

The influence of post-weld direct tempering (PWDT: 1033 K (760\\xa0°C)/ 90 minutes + air cooling) and post-weld normalizing and tempering (PWNT: 1253 K (980\\xa0°C)/30 minutes + air cooling + tempering 1033 K (760\\xa0°C)/90 minutes + air cooling) treatments on microstructure and mechanical properties has also been assessed. The base metal (BM) microstructure was tempered martensite comprising Cr-rich M23C6 on prior austenite grain and lath boundaries with intra-lath precipitation of V- and Ta-rich MC precipitates. The tool rotational speed exerted profound influence on evolving microstructure in SZ, TMAZ, and HAZ in the as-welded and post-weld heat-treated states. Very high proportion of prior austenitic grains and martensite lath boundaries in SZ and TMAZ in the as-welded state showed lack of strengthening precipitates, though very high hardness was recorded in SZ irrespective of the tool speed. Very fine-needle-like Fe3C precipitates were found at both the rotational speeds in SZ. The Fe3C was dissolved and fresh precipitation of strengthening precipitates occurred on both prior austenite grain and sub-grain boundaries in SZ during PWNT and PWDT. The post-weld direct tempering caused coarsening and coalescence of strengthening precipitates, in both matrix and grain boundary regions of TMAZ and HAZ, which led to inhomogeneous distribution of hardness across the weld joint. The PWNT heat treatment has shown fresh precipitation of M23C6 on lath and grain boundaries and very fine V-rich MC precipitates in the intragranular regions, which is very much similar to that prevailed in BM prior to FSW. Both the PWDT and PWNT treatments caused considerable reduction in the hardness of SZ. In the as-welded state, the 200 rpm joints have shown room temperature impact toughness close to that of BM, whereas 700 rpm joints exhibited very poor impact toughness. The best combination of microstructure and mechanical properties could be obtained by employing low rotational speed of 200 rpm followed by PWNT cycle. The type and size of various precipitates, grain size, and evolving dislocation substructure have been presented and comprehensively discussed. © 2017, The Minerals, Metals and Materials Society and ASM International.'\n",
      " \"An improved version of Otsu's method for segmentation of weld defects on X-radiography imagesIt is highly desirable to increase the accuracy of automatic weld defect detection in X-radiography for non-destructive testing and evaluation. For this purpose, a machine vision method is proposed for weld defect segmentation, using the Least Probability Weighted Background Group (LPWBG), an improved version of Otsu's method. This automatically selects a desired threshold value for segmenting the weld defects by adapting the Weibull distribution. The least non-zero probability value of gray-levels of the whole image has been considered as a weighted parameter of the background group of Otsu's within-class criterion. It has been determined that the resulting threshold value will always lie at the left bottom side of the unimodal distribution, especially when the defects are smaller than the background area. Existing approaches such as Otsu's threshold, valley-emphasis, neighborhood valley-emphasis, and weighted object variance have similarly been tried and compared with the proposed method. Our results establish that the proposed method provides satisfactory segmentation results over the others. The performance of the LPWBG method has been both evaluated and compared, using Misclassification Error measure (ME) with significant results. © 2017 Elsevier GmbH\"\n",

Bead-on-plate welds were carried out based on the design matrix. The input variables considered were laser power, pulse frequency, pulse duration, and TIG current. The response variable considered was the DOP. Multiple-regression model was developed correlating the process variables with the DOP using the generated data. The regression model was used for evaluating the objective function in GA. GA-based model was developed and it produced a set of solutions. Tournament and roulette wheel selection methods were used during the execution of GA.

The braze joints are characterised by scanning electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, micro-hardness measurement. With increasing brazing temperature from 980 to 1040°C, the approximate width of the braze layer decreases from 350 to 80 µm and hardness reduces from 600 to 410 VHN. However, not much difference is found in microstructure and hardness between braze joints produced at 1020 and 1040°C.

A ‘Flow Softening Index (FSI)’ has been identified on the basis of investigations on elevated temperature deformation behaviour of austenitic stainless steel.

The results of SEM and TEM show the morphological features of the prepared Cu2ZnxNi1-xSnS4 nanoparticles. The optical band gaps of the prepared Cu2ZnxNi1-xSnS4 nanoparticles were reduced from 1.63\\xa0eV (x=1) to 1.36\\xa0eV (x=0). It falls well within the suitable band gap range of absorber materials to be useful for thin film solar cell applications. Photoresponse behavior of Cu2ZnxNi1-xSnS4 (x=1 and 0.75) thin films under dark and light illumination indicates the potential of Cu2ZnxNi1-xSnS4 nanoparticles as an alternate absorber material in low-cost thin film solar cells applications. © 2017'\n",
      " 'A comparative assessment of fatigue deformation behavior of 316 LN SS at ambient and high temperatureIn this study, the low cycle fatigue deformation of 316 LN stainless steel has been assessed and compared for relatively low and high temperatures. Low cycle fatigue tests were carried out on the steel at 298\\xa0K and 873\\xa0K employing strain amplitudes ranging from ±0.3% to ±1.0% at a strain rate of 3×10−3\\xa0s−1. At both the temperatures, the material exhibited initial hardening followed by gradual softening to the saturation stage and final failure. Comparison of hysteresis loops at saturation revealed that the material exhibited Masing behavior at lower strain amplitudes and non-Masing behavior at relatively higher strain amplitudes at 298\\xa0K whereas a reverse trend was observed at 873\\xa0K. Manifestation of Masing and non-Masing behavior was reflected in the dual slope cyclic stress- strain relationship. The change from Masing to non-Masing behavior and vice versa depending on the temperature and strain amplitude has been corroborated with the transmission electron microscopic and electron backscattered diffraction investigation. The dislocation substructure was found to depend on the temperature and strain amplitude. At 298\\xa0K, pile-up in the planar slip and tendency to develop cell structure was observed at lower and higher strain amplitudes, respectively. However, dislocation pinning resulting from DSA and well developed cell structure was observed at lower and higher strain amplitudes, respectively at 873\\xa0K. The fatigue life has been predicted based on the hysteresis energy approach considering both the Masing and non-Masing behavior and it was observed that the non-Masing analysis predicts the fatigue life more accurately than the Masing analysis. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.'\n",
      " 'Evaluation of strength property variations across 9Cr-1Mo steel weld joints using automated ball indentation (ABI) techniqueThe variations of strength properties across 9Cr-1Mo steel weld joints fabricated by different arc welding processes such as shielded metal arc welding (SMAW), tungsten inert gas (TIG) and activated tungsten inert gas (A-TIG) have been evaluated employing automatic ball indentation (ABI) technique. ABI tests were conducted at 298\\xa0K across various zones of the weld joints comprising of base metal, weld metal, heat affected zone (HAZ) and intercritical HAZ (ICHAZ) regions. The flow curves obtained from ABI tests were correlated with corresponding conventional tensile test results. In general, the tensile strength decreased systematically across the weld joint from weld metal to base metal. Inter critical HAZ exhibited the least strength implying that it is the weakest zone. The incomplete phase transformation in the ICHAZ during weld thermal cycle caused the softening. The A-TIG weld metal exhibited higher UTS and strain hardening values due to higher carbon in the martensite. The strain hardening exponent exhibited only slight variation across the various regions of the weld joints. A-TIG weld joint exhibited higher weld metal and HAZ strength, marginally higher UTS to YS ratio in the weld metal and HAZ compared to that of the other two processes. Hence, among the three welding processes chosen, A-TIG welding process is found to be superior in producing a 9Cr-1Mo steel weld joint with better strength properties. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.'\n",

The formation of nanocrystalline grains has been observed in the cryo-rolled sample accompanied by a significant improvement in yield strength whereas the grain refinement is not significant in case of room temperature rolled sample. Suppression of dynamic recovery plays a major role in the formation of nanostructured material. The evolution of micro-texture during room temperature rolling and cryo-rolling has been compared in this study. The rolling texture of room temperature and cryo-rolled samples are similar to the rolling texture predicted for hexagonal materials with c/a <1.6. XRD analysis indicates peaks shift to lower 2θ with increase in rolling strains indicating the presence of tensile residual strains. Peak broadening is also observed indicating an increase in defect density and decrease in grain size. © 2016, The Indian Institute of Metals - IIM.'\n",
      " 'Long term creep-fatigue interaction studies on India-specific reduced activation ferritic-martensitic (IN-RAFM) steelDeterioration in fatigue life occurs due to introduction of hold in peak tensile or peak compressive or in both peak tensile and compressive strains in a triangular waveform. The hold period of a creep fatigue interaction (CFI) cycle denote the uninterrupted service period during which creep damage is predominant. CFI experiments comprising of long hold periods are relatively scarce but are indispensable for the understanding of long term materials behavior under CFI. Keeping this in view, CFI experiments have been performed at 823\\xa0K on a commercial heat of reduced activation ferritic-martensitic (RAFM) steel using different directions of hold (tensile hold alone, compressive hold alone and simultaneous tensile and compressive holds) for different durations and by employing two strain amplitudes, ±0.25% and ±0.6%. The extent of deterioration in fatigue life in IN-RAFM steel is found to be dependent upon the direction of application of hold. Factors such as oxidation, plastic strain accumulation, mean stresses and stress relaxation during the application of the hold played a significant role in affecting CFI life of RAFM steel. The importance of stress relaxation (SR) in assessing fatigue damage under CFI has been described. A universal relationship between CFI life and SR has been arrived at and which is found to be independent of the type of the waveform, strain amplitude or the duration of hold. Though the relationship between stress relaxation and fatigue life is non-linear, the log–log plot between SR and CFI life value depict an inverse linear relationship. The sum of least squares of the offset from the linear fit, R2 is 0.93 which is a reasonably good approximation. The log–log plot of SR versus CFI life denotes the creep-fatigue interaction line and can be used to predict CFI life for a given amount of SR occurring in the material. The proposed relationship is applicable only for long duration CFI experiments and depicts microstructural creep-fatigue interaction in true sense. Test conditions that do not prominently show the effects of creep-fatigue interaction, do not fall on the CFI interaction line. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd'\n",

The CV curves of Ti specimens with 15\\xa0days old biofilms showed characteristic redox peaks with high cathodic current indicating the electroactive biofilms. Similarly impedance spectra clearly showed two time constants with decrease in charge transfer resistance and increase in capacitance as the biofilms growth increased on the Ti specimens.

ODS Fe-18%Cr-2%W-0.2%Ti steels with 0, 0.35, 0.5, 1 and 1.5% Y2O3 (all compositions in weight%) dispersion were fabricated by mechanical alloying of elemental powders. The powders were placed in a mild steel can and forged in a stream of hydrogen gas at 1473\\xa0K. The steels were forged again to final density. The strength of ODS steel increased with yttria content. Though this was accompanied by a decrease in tensile elongation, all the steels showed significant ductility. The ductility in high yttria alloys may be attributed to improved inter-particle bonding between milled powders due to reduction of surface oxides by hydrogen. This may permit development of ODS steels with yttria contents higher than the conventional limit of 0.5%. It is suggested that powder forging is a promising route to fabricate ODS steels with high yttria contents and improved ductility. © 2017'\n",

Concrete mixes namely Normal Concrete (NC), concrete with fly ash and superplasticizer (FA) and concrete with superplasticizer alone (SP) were cast and immersed for a year to find out the strength, durability, biofilms formation and chemical composition. The pH, compressive strength, Half Cell Potential (HCP), Rapid Chloride Permeability Test (RCPT) and carbonation test showed better results in FA. Epifluorescence micrograph observed less number of fluorescing cells. Analysis of phase images of Lock- in thermography reveals the phase angle differences of concrete samples indicating the least deterioration on FA concrete. After 280 days of exposure, XRD showed higher loss of calcium elements in NC and SP concrete compared to FA. LRS also showed that Raman intensities of NC and SP were drastically reduced. However, LRS and XRD results of FA confirmed formation of more cementitious products due to secondary hydration explaining the reason for increased compressive strength. © 2017, Korean Society of Civil Engineers and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.'\n",
      " 'Effect of Microalloy Precipitates on the Microstructure and Texture of Hot-Deformed Modified 9Cr-1Mo SteelMicroalloying elements like Nb and V are added to modified 9Cr-1Mo steel to ensure excellent creep resistance by the formation of fine MX precipitates during tempering treatment. The effect of those elements on the evolution of microstructure (and texture) in hot-deformed steel has hardly been studied. Industrial processing of modified 9Cr-1Mo steel often develops deformed and elongated prior-austenite grain structure, which can be detrimental from property point of view. The present study shows that the formation of such structure can primarily be attributed to the pinning effect from strain-induced Nb(C,N) precipitation, which can effectively retard the static recrystallization of deformed-γ at high-deformation temperature and short inter-pass times (~10 seconds). Based on the results, the application of either heavy deformation pass at high-temperature or multiple-lighter passes maintaining sufficient inter-pass interval (30 to 50 seconds) is recommended to achieve fine and equiaxed γ-grain structure by dynamic recrystallization and static recrystallization, respectively. © 2017, The Minerals, Metals and Materials Society and ASM International.'\n",
      " 'Development of heat sink concept for near-term fusion power plant divertorDevelopment of an efficient divertor concept is an important task to meet in the scenario of the future fusion power plant. The divertor, which is a vital part of the reactor has to discharge the considerable fraction of the total fusion thermal power (∼15%). Therefore, it has to survive very high thermal fluxes (∼10 MW/m2). In the present paper, an efficient divertor heat exchanger cooled by helium is proposed for the fusion tokamak. The Plasma facing surface of divertor made-up of several modules to overcome the stresses caused by high heat flux. The thermal hydraulic performance of one such module is numerically investigated in the present work. The result shows that the proposed design is capable of handling target heat flux values of 10 MW/m2.

      " 'Multi-stimuli responsive nanofluid with easy-to-visualize structural color patternsWe present the details of a multi- stimuli responsive nanofluid with easy-to-visualize structural color patterns. We have used a thermo-responsive polymer, Poly (N-isopropylacrylamide)(PNIPAM) and superparamagnetic nanoparticle to realize both thermal and magnetic actuation of the nanofluid. PNIPAM molecules adsorbed at the oil-water (O/W) interface acts as a stabilizer cum thermo-responsible moiety, while the superparamagnetic nanoparticles make the nanofluid magnetically responsive. Under a constant magnetic field and in the temperature range of 5–30\\xa0°C, the interdroplet separation is reversibly tuned from 82 to 52\\xa0nm. The reversible swelling and collapse of polymer adsorbed at the O/W interface is manifested from the Bragg peak shift at a constant magnetic force. Above the lower critical solution temperature (>35\\xa0°C), a strong attraction between adsorbed PNIPAM layers caused the bridging of PNIPAM covered droplets, which was evident from the disappearance of Bragg peak after the removal of magnetic stimulus and the presence of bridged long flexible chains of drops. It is observed that the incorporation of a small amount of anionic surfactant monomers dramatically increases the volume phase transition, the repulsive interaction forces and the interparticle tunability due to strong association of PNIPAM and sodium dodecyl suphate (SDS). Our results suggest that by using PNIPAM and an anionic surfactant, the interparticle interactions and optical properties of magnetically polarizable nanofluids can be reversibly tuned. Thermo-magneto responsive nanoemulsions offer exciting applications in optical devices (2D and 3D photonic crystals, optical gratings, body temperature sensor etc.), smart drug delivery systems and sensors.

Nitrogen content was varied between 0.07 and 0.22\\xa0wt%. Creep tests have been carried out on the steels over the stress range of 120–225\\xa0MPa at 923\\xa0K. The creep behaviour of the steels has been assessed based on Garofalo relationship, ε= εo+ εT[1 - exp(- rt) ] + ε˙ st. The rate of exhaustion of primary creep rate ‘r’ and steady state creep rate ‘ε˙ s’ decrease and time to onset the secondary creep stage increases with nitrogen content. The relationships between the initial creep rate ‘ε˙ i’and rate of exhaustion of primary creep rate ‘r’ with steady creep rate ‘ε˙ s’ reveal that the same deformation mechanism prevails during the transient and steady state creep deformations. Attempt has been made to generate a master transient creep curve for the steels having different nitrogen contents using the above parameters. Even though for a steel of specific nitrogen content, master curve has been generated for different stress levels, a master curve for all the steel could not be established. Different deformation characteristics of the steel having different nitrogen content which effect the stacking fault energy as well as precipitation behaviour is considered for the disagreement. © 2017, The Indian Institute of Metals - IIM.'\n",

A defect-free weld joint between mild steel (MS) (Fe-0.14 pct C) and Ti Grade 2 obtained by friction welding is diffusion annealed for various durations to study the interdiffusion behavior under equilibrium conditions, while an explosive clad joint is used to study interdiffusion under nonequilibrium conditions. From the elemental concentration profiles obtained across the MS-Ti interface using electron-probe microanalysis and imaging of the interface, the formation of distinct diffusion zones as a function of temperature and time is established. Concentration and temperature dependence of the interdiffusion coefficients (D(c)) and activation energies are determined. Under equilibrium conditions, the change in molar volume with concentration shows a close match with the ideal Vegard’s law, whereas a negative deviation is observed for nonequilibrium conditions. This deviation can be attributed to the formation of secondary phases, which, in turn, alters the D(c) values of diffusing species. Calculations showed that the D0 and activation energy for interdiffusion under equilibrium is on the order of 10−11\\xa0m2/s and 147\\xa0kJ/mol, whereas it is far lower in the nonequilibrium case (10−10\\xa0m2/s and 117\\xa0kJ/mol) in the compositional range of 40 to 50 wt pct Fe, which also manifests as accelerated growth kinetics of the different diffusion zones. © 2017, The Minerals, Metals and Materials Society and ASM International.'\n",

The steel is being used for construction of Indian Aircraft Carrier and other new ships under construction at various ship yards in India. In order to enhance the depth of penetration (DOP) achievable in a single pass for gas tungsten arc welding (GTAW) process, activated fluxes were developed for the steel. The process is called activated flux gas tungsten arc welding (A-GTAW). Design of experiments (DOE) approach was employed using response surface methodology (RSM) and Taguchi technique to optimize the welding parameters for achieving maximum DOP in a single pass. Design matrix was generated using DOE techniques and bead on plate experiments were carried out to generate data for influence of welding process variables on DOP. The input variables considered were current, torch speed, and arc gap. The DOP was considered as response variable. The equations correlating DOP with the process parameters were developed for both the optimization techniques. The identified optimum process parameters were validated by carrying out bead on plate experiments. The RMS error of the predicted and measured DOP values for the validation experiments of the RSM (D-optimal) and Taguchi optimization technique was found to be 0.575 and 0.860, respectively.

Then multi-component activated flux was developed which was found to produce a significant increase in penetration of 10-12\\xa0mm in single-pass TIG welding of type 304LN and 316LN stainless steels. The significant improvement in penetration achieved using the activated flux developed in the present work has been attributed to the constriction of the arc and as well as reversal of Marangoni flow in the molten weld pool. The use of activated flux has been found to overcome the variable weld penetration observed in 316LN stainless steel with <50\\xa0ppm of sulfur. There was no degradation in the microstructure and mechanical properties of the A-TIG welds compared to that of the welds produced by conventional TIG welding on the contrary the transverse strength properties of the 304LN and 316LN stainless steel welds produced by A-TIG welding exceeded the minimum specified strength values of the base metals. Improvement in toughness values were observed in 316LN stainless steel produced by A-TIG welding due to refinement in the weld microstructure in the region close to the weld center.

Remnant HCF lives were found to decrease drastically with increase in prior fatigue exposure as a result of strong LCF–HCF interactions. The rate of decrease in remnant lives varied as a function of the applied strain amplitude. A threshold damage in terms of prior LCF life-fraction was found, below which no significant LCF–HCF interaction takes place. Similarly, a critical damage during the LCF pre-cycling marking the highest degree of LCF–HCF interaction was identified which was found to depend on the applied strain amplitude. In view of the non-linear damage accumulation behavior, Miner’s linear damage rule proved to be highly non-conservative. Manson’s damage curve approach, suitably modified, was found to be a better alternative for predicting the remnant HCF life.

SiO2 was used as activating flux for A-TIG welding, while SUPERTIG ER309L was used as filler for M-TIG welding. Bead-on-plate weld trials were carried out to obtain the full penetration by using different combinations of flux coating density, welding speed and welding current. An optical microscope, field emission scanning microscope (FESEM), and x-ray diffractometer were used for the metallurgical characterizations. Vickers hardness, tensile test, Charpy toughness test, and creep behavior test were carried out to evaluate the mechanical properties of the base and weld metals. Experimental results indicate that the A-TIG process can increase the joint penetration and tends to reduce the angular distortion of the 409 FSS weldment. The A-TIG welded joint also exhibited greater mechanical strength. However, a critically low Charpy toughness was measured for the A-TIG weld fusion zone, which was later sufficiently improved after post weld heat treatment (PWHT).

The tempered martensitic steel received in the normalized and tempered (Nandamp;T) condition was thermally aged at 873\\xa0K for 5000\\xa0h. Thermal ageing was found to decrease hardness and tensile strength and the decrease was accompanied with increase in ductility. The steel displayed plateaus/humps in the temperature variation of yield stress and ultimate tensile strength and dip in ductility over the range 473–673\\xa0K, which is considered due to the occurrence of dynamic strain ageing (DSA). The prevalence of DSA activity was found more on thermal ageing. Increase in ductile to brittle transition temperature (DBTT) and decrease in upper shelf energy (USE) of the steel were observed on thermal ageing. Detailed microscopic investigation of the steel revealed coarsening of martensitic sub-boundaries and M23C6 carbides along with the precipitation of Laves phase on thermal ageing. Coarsening of microstructural features on thermal ageing is considered to influence the reduction in strength and USE of the steel; whereas coarsening of M23C6 and precipitation of Laves phase is considered to cause the increase in DBTT. SEM fractographic study of the impact specimens revealed three distinct zones as shear lip, fibrous dimple and cleavage in an ordered away from the notch tip. With decrease in test temperature, the widths of the shear lip and fibrous dimple zones deceased whereas width of the cleavage zone increased progressively. Thermal ageing increased the widths of the shear lip and fibrous dimple zones and decreased the cleavage zone in the Nandamp;T steel at relatively higher temperatures but at lower test temperatures cleavage zone became more predominant. TEM study of the specimens extracted from the impact fractured samples at the vicinity of fracture surface, revealed substantial activity of dislocations manifested as dislocation debris in Nandamp;T steel even for impact testing at −80\\xa0°C against individual dislocations for the aged steel, implying enhancement of DBTT on thermal ageing. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.'\n",

The electrorefining process is carried out using 5-6\\xa0wt.% UCl3 in LiCl-KCl molten salt as the electrolyte at 500\\xa0°C under argon atmosphere. In the present study, to protect the container vessel from hot corrosion by the molten salt, 8-9% yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) ceramic coating was deposited on 9Cr-1Mo steel by atmospheric plasma spray process.

The creep tests were carried out on both smooth and notched specimens of the steel at 873\\xa0K in the stress range of 270-340\\xa0MPa. The notched specimens had root radius ranging from 0.83\\xa0mm to 5\\xa0mm. The detailed finite element analysis has been carried out to assess the triaxial state of stress across the notch incorporating Norton’s law as creep deformation governing mechanism. The creep rupture life of the steel increased in presence of triaxial stresses and extent of which was more at lower net applied stresses and higher triaxiality (sharper notch). The reduction in effective stress in presence of notch resulted in higher creep rupture life of the steel under triaxial stresses. The fracture surfaces revealed mixed mode failure consisting of dimple ductile and intergranular creep cavitation for all testing conditions, however, extent of cavitation was higher for relatively higher triaxialities and lower net applied stresses. The creep ductility of the steel was found to decrease drastically under triaxial state of stress. The triaxial rupture life and creep ductility of the steel have been assessed based on different models on incorporating different components of stresses at the skeletal point. © 2016, ASM International.'\n",

      " 'Magnetorheological properties of sodium sulphonate capped electrolytic iron based MR fluid: A comparison with CI based MR fluidMagnetorheological fluids have numerous engineering applications due to their interesting field assisted rheological behavior. Most commonly used dispersed phase in MR fluids is carbonyl iron (CI). The relatively high cost of CI warrants the need to develop cheaper alternatives to CI, without compromising rheological properties. With the above goal in mind, we have synthesized sodium sulphonate capped electrolytic iron based MR fluid and studied their magnetorheological properties. The results are compared with that of CI based MR fluid. EI and CI particles of average particle size of ∼10 μm with fumed silica particles additives are used in the present study. The dynamic yield stress for EI and CI based MR fluid were found to vary with field strength with an exponent of roughly 1.2 and 1.24, respectively. The slightly lower static and dynamic yield stress values of EI based MR fluid is attributed to the lower magnetization and polydispersity values. The dynamic yield stress showed a decrease of 18.73% and 61.8% for field strengths of 177 mT and 531 mT, respectively as the temperature was increased from 293 to 323 K. The optorheological studies showed a peak in the loss moduli, close to the crossover point of the storage and loss moduli, due to freely moving large sized aggregates along the shear direction that are dislodged from the rheometer plates at higher strains. Our results suggests that EI based MR fluids have magnetorheological behavior comparable to that of CI based MR fluids. As EI is much cheaper than CI, our findings will have important commercial implications in producing cost effective EI based MR fluids. © 2016 IOP Publishing Ltd.'\n",
      " 'Studies on Creep Deformation and Rupture Behavior of 316LN SS Multi-Pass Weld Joints Fabricated with Two Different Electrode SizesEffect of electrode size on creep deformation and rupture behavior has been assessed by carrying out creep tests at 923 K (650\\xa0°C) over the stress range 140 to 225 MPa on 316LN stainless steel weld joints fabricated employing 2.5 and 4 mm diameter electrodes. The multi-pass welding technique not only changes the morphology of delta ferrite from vermicular to globular in the previous weld bead region near to the weld bead interface, but also subjects the region to thermo-mechanical heat treatment to generate appreciable strength gradient. Electron backscatter diffraction analysis revealed significant localized strain gradients in regions adjoining the weld pass interface for the joint fabricated with large electrode size. Larger electrode diameter joint exhibited higher creep rupture strength than the smaller diameter electrode joint. However, both the joints had lower creep rupture strength than the base metal. Failure in the joints was associated with microstructural instability in the fusion zone, and the vermicular delta ferrite zone was more prone to creep cavitation. Larger electrode diameter joint was found to be more resistant to failure caused by creep cavitation than the smaller diameter electrode joint. This has been attributed to the larger strength gradient between the beads and significant separation between the cavity prone vermicular delta ferrite zones which hindered the cavity growth. Close proximity of cavitated zones in smaller electrode joint facilitated their faster coalescence leading to more reduction in creep rupture strength. Failure location in the joints was found to depend on the electrode size and applied stress. The change in failure location has been assessed on performing finite element analysis of stress distribution across the joint on incorporating tensile and creep strengths of different constituents of joints, estimated by ball indentation and impression creep testing techniques. © 2016, The Minerals, Metals and Materials Society and ASM International.'\n",
      " 'Wavelet transform-based approach for processing ultrasonic B-scan imagesThe attenuation of ultrasound beams in coarse-grained austenitic stainless steels due to grain boundary scattering influences flaw detection and sizing. This paper presents an approach for processing ultrasonic B-scan images of thick coarse-grained austenitic stainless steel parts using a discrete wavelet transform (DWT) technique. In this approach, DWT processing of A-scan signals obtained during B-scan imaging is performed to reduce the noise caused by grain boundary scattering. The Daubechies (db8) mother wavelet with decomposition level 5 is found to be optimum for this purpose. Experimental studies are carried out on coarse-grained stainless steel specimens having flaws machined at different depths. These studies reveal that the proposed approach results in an improvement of more than 13 dB in signalto-noise ratio, as compared to two-dimensional DWT processing of the original B-scan image using the same wavelet and decomposition level. Furthermore, the proposed approach produces a smaller number of artefacts than the twodimensional DWT technique. The studies reveal that by using the proposed approach it is possible to detect flat-bottomed holes located at 40 mm below the surface of a 50 mm-thick stainless steel part with a grain size of 200 μm at normal incidence. The proposed approach is fast and attractive for online implementation. © 2017, British Institute of Non-Destructive Testing. All rights reserved.'\n",
      " 'Microstructural and microchemical studies of phase stability in V-O solid solutionOver the last couple of decades vanadium and V-based alloys have received significant attention as a potential structural material for fusion power applications because of their favourable mechanical properties under irradiation and at elevated temperatures. They are also considered as the advanced options of storage materials for hydrogen and its isotopes. However, the higher affinity of V for O, C and N poses critical challenges in its engineering applications since they lead to degradation of mechanical properties. They can further interact with the matrix to produce metallic oxy-carbo-nitride precipitates. To a certain limit, these precipitates are beneficial and can be exploited to enhance the mechanical behaviour of the alloy through suitable microstructural design. However, this requires a prior knowledge of the interaction between the alloy and the impurity solutes. In the present work vanadium specific experiments have been designed and carried out to bring out the V-interstitial solute interaction by charging oxygen in the near surface region of vanadium. Microstructural and microchemical behaviour of the V-O solid solution has been studied through HRTEM (high resolution transmission electron microscopy) and HAADF (high angle annular dark field) coupled with EELS. Quantitative electron microscopy has been carried out to study structural modification of the alloy in atomic level caused by O charging. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.'\n",

The microstructure and corrosion resistance of laser surface melted 304L SS weldment was evaluated and compared with that of 304L SS as-weldment and 304L SS base.

Corrosion investigations were carried out in 4 and 8\\xa0M nitric acid by potentiodynamic polarization technique. From the results, it was found that laser surface melting of the weldment led to chemical and microstructural homogeneities, accompanied by a substantial decrease in delta ferrite content, that enhanced the corrosion resistance of the weldment in 4 and 8\\xa0M nitric acid. However, the enhancement in the corrosion resistance was not substantial. The presence of small amount of delta ferrite (2-4\\xa0wt.%) in the laser surface melted specimens was found to be detrimental in nitric acid.

For the safety assessment of such weld joints, critical importance to be given for the estimation of magnitude and distribution of residual stresses. Initially, a three dimensional finite element (FE) model is developed to simulate the GTAW process using SYSWELD for joining the different cases of AISI 304L branch pipe T-joints. During simulations, a sequentially coupled thermo-metallurgical-mechanical analysis is performed to study the temperature and weld induced residual stress distributions. Significant differences in 3D temperature profiles, temperature distributions and residual stress states are noticed between run and branch pipes for different pipe sizes along different sections. Also, the accuracy of the developed FE simulation strategy is validated for transient temperature distributions and residual stress fields through full-scale shop floor welding experiments. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd'\n",
      " 'Conduction electrons as dissipation channel in friction experiments at the metal-metal transition of LSMO measured by contact-resonance atomic force microscopyWe report on friction measurements on a La0.6Sr0.4MnO3 (LSMO) thin film using atomic force microscopy cantilever contact-resonances. There is a contribution to the damping of the cantilever oscillations, which is caused by micro-sliding of the cantilever tip on the surface of the thin film. This frictional part decreases with temperature parallel to the increase in the resistivity of the thin film. The LSMO is well-known for a ferromagnetic to paramagnetic phase transition that occurs without changes in the rhombohedral (R-3c) crystalline structure. The magnetic transition at the Curie temperature TC ∼ 360 K is accompanied by a metal-to-metal transition with a large increase in electrical resistivity. The behavior of the cantilever damping constant demonstrates that there is a direct coupling between mechanical friction and the mobility of the electrons in the LSMO film. © 2017 Author(s).'\n",
      " 'Mechanisms of failure under low cycle fatigue, high cycle fatigue and creep interactions in combined cycling in a type 316LN stainless steelThe present study investigates the effect of different damage modes like low cycle fatigue (LCF), high cycle fatigue (HCF), creep and their interactions during combined cycling at high temperature (923 K) in a 316LN stainless steel. The experiments were designed with multi-step load sequences where specific number of small amplitude HCF cycles (block) were introduced at the stabilized cyclic load under LCF for a given strain amplitude and repeated until failure. Cyclic life was found to decrease with the increase in HCF block size. However, the extent of decrease in cyclic life also depends on the LCF strain amplitude, which is attributed to the additional damage incurred by creep and ratcheting. Creep damage was found to be opposed by a strong compressive ratcheting originating from Bauschinger effect, resulting in net strain accumulation in tensile or compressive direction depending on whichever damage process of the two is dominant. Typically, fatigue fracture, intergranular creep fracture or creep rupture can be identified when failure was dictated by LCF or creep. However, failure life was actually found to be governed by multiple damage interactions between LCF, HCF and creep for specific loading conditions, as emphasized through detailed fracture surface investigations. HCF damage was found to act as a catalyst by joining small transgranular (LCF) or intergranular (creep) cracks, thus facilitating the crack propagation and final failure by the respective modes. This leads to strong synergistic LCF-HCF-creep or HCF-creep interaction, the regimes of which were suitably mapped as a function of LCF strain amplitude and block size. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.'\n",

The evolution of the microstructure at different stages of production of Zircaloy-4 tubes was characterized using scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Microstructural evolution follows the sequence as dendritic structure (as-cast ingot) → Widmanstätten structure (β-quenched) → bimodal grain size (hot extruded) → heterogeneous deformed structure (pilgered) → partially recrystallized structure (final annealed). High strength and low ductility were obtained for the Zircaloy-4 tubes at pilgered condition due to grain size refinement and work hardening during the pilgering process. Compared with the pilgering stage, the Zircaloy-4 tubes in the final annealed condition exhibited moderate strength and high ductility due to the partially recrystallized microstructure. Autoclaving was carried out to improve the corrosion properties of the pilgered Zircaloy-4 tubes in boiling 11.5 M nitric acid. When exposed to boiling 11.5 M nitric acid for 1000 h, a lowest corrosion rate of 0.003 mpy was obtained for autoclaved Zircaloy-4 tubes. Laser Raman Spectroscopy (LRS) analysis confirmed that the origin of passivity of pilgered and autoclaved Zircaloy-4 tubes was due to the presence of a protective passive film composed of ZrO2. © 2017, Copyright © Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.'\n",

Viscosity data were used to calculate the activation energy of viscous flow. The activation energy was observed to increase with increase in the concentration of aqueous solutions of PEG which indicated that more energy is required to move the molecule inside the structure with increase in concentration. The measured data provided better understanding to explain the behaviour of macromolecules with respect to change in concentration and temperature. The results were discussed in the light of polymer-solvent interactions. At lower concentration range, the molecules exhibit weak interaction due to dominant repulsive force and at higher concentration the entanglement of polymer chain increases. In view of greater force of interaction between solute and solvent molecules forming hydrogen bonding, there will be an increase in interaction with temperature and concentration. © 2017 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston 2017.'\n",

The addition of molybdenum to titanium is found to shift the stability of crystal structure from hcp to orthorhombic to bcc, as expected. The unit cell dimensions and the atomic positions of α′, α″ and β phases were evaluated, with excellent reliability indices. The reduction in unit cell dimensions and its volume, bond length and co-ordination number with addition of molybdenum is consistent with the reduced size of solute atom. The orthorhombic α″ phase, a transition phase with a minor distortion of hcp α′, is found to be closer to α′ than β phase, based on the orthorhombicity (b/a) and the volume of equivalent orthorhombic unit cells of the phases and the atomic shuffle y in 4c Wyckoff positions along b axis of α″ phase. The Fourier electron density contour maps suggest that the bonding in all phases is predominantly metallic. However, addition of molybdenum delocalizes the spatial distribution of charge density, suggesting an enhancement of metallic character. Anisotropy in charge density was observed along 〈011〉 and 〈010〉 in (100), 〈101〉 and 〈001〉 in (010) and 〈110〉 and 〈010〉 in (001) plane.

Experiments are performed on ferrofluid samples of five different concentrations and under four different external field amplitudes at a fixed frequency. The temperature rise curves measured using both the infrared thermography and fiber optic sensor are found to be very similar up to a certain time interval, above which deviations are observed, which are attributed to the internal and external convection phenomena. A correction methodology is developed to account for the convection losses. The convection corrected specific absorption rate is found to be in good agreement with the values obtained from the conventional fiber optic temperature sensor, within a maximum error of ±3.4%. The highest specific absorption rate obtained in the present study is 135.98 (±4.6) W/gFe for a sample concentration of 3 wt.%, at an external field amplitude and a frequency of 63.0 kA m−1 and 126 kHz, respectively. The specific absorption rate is found to decrease with increasing sample concentration, due to the enhancement of dipolar interaction with increasing sample concentration due to agglomeration.

TGA and FTIR analysis confirm the adsorption of biotin and lawsone on the nanoparticles. Upon functionalization of nanoparticles with biotin and lawsone, they acquire negative charge and show an increased hydrodynamic diameter. The phase contrast microscopy images show the formation of reversible chain-like structures under an external magnetic field, indicating the strong adsorption of biotin and lawsone molecules. The functionalized nanoparticles are examined for their ability to remove rhodamine B dye and lead ions from water. The percentage removal of rhodamine B by biotin and lawsone functionalized nanoparticles is found to be ∼89%. Similarly, the percentage removal of lead ions by nanoparticles functionalized with biotin and lawsone is found to be 42 and 82 %, respectively. The uncoated nanoparticles were not suitable for removing rhodamine and lead ions. In summary, both biotin and lawsone functionalized nanoparticles are found to be efficient for the removal of rhodamine-B. Nanoparticles functionalized with lawsone are found to be a better system for the removal of lead ions than biotin functionalized nanoparticles. These functionalized nanoparticles are ideal for the removal of dye and the metal ion from aqueous system, since the nanoparticles are easy to retrieve using a magnet. © Copyright 2017 American Scientific Publishers All rights reserved.'\n",

Three stage behaviour exhibited by the work hardening characteristics is considerably influenced by deformation temperature and strain rate. The critical stress (σc) and critical strain (εc) for triggering dynamic recrystallization determined from the work hardening curves is related to Zener-Hollomon parameter through a power law relationship. Deformation microstructures investigated by Electron Backscattered Diffraction (EBSD) studies highlighted the dominance of discontinuous dynamic recrystallization (DDRX) evidenced by serrated/bulged grain boundaries and necklace type microstructure, although DRX volume fraction is strongly sensitive to deformation conditions. Dislocation accumulation studied by grain reference orientation deviation (GROD) maps corroborates to the observed deformation microstructures. Modest DRX is observed at the lowest deformation temperatures owing to the insufficient thermal energy; however, DDRX kinetics is enhanced at higher temperatures. Additionally, the grain boundary characteristics and misorientation angle distribution are studied and correlated with the microstructural evolution. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.'\n",
      " 'Thermal expansion and residual stress behaviour of electron beam evaporated yttria stabilized zirconia films on Inconel-690 substratesNuclear vitrification components used in melter pot made of Ni-base superalloys degrade prematurely due to alloy-waste glass interaction and the formation of secondary precipitates. Deposition of cubic yttria stabilized zirconia (c-YSZ) coating has been recommended as a diffusion barrier material to delay or reduce the failure of the alloy and to enable an extended life. In the present work, c-YSZ films have been deposited on Inconel-690 substrate by electron beam evaporation technique at various substrate temperatures from 673 K to 973 K. The residual stress in the film surface and at the film/substrate interface was measured using grazing incidence x-ray diffraction (GIXRD) with various incidence angles. It was observed that the residual stress at the film/substrate interface region changes from tensile to compressive when the substrate temperature was increased from 673 K to 973 K during deposition. Furthermore, the thermal expansion coefficient (TEC) of Inconel-690 substrate and YSZ film coated Inconel-690 substrate were determined by high temperature (HTXRD) measurement in the temperature range of 298–1273 K with 100 K interval. The linear TECs of Inconel-690 and YSZ coated Inconel-690 at 1273 K were found to be 1.53 × 10−5 K−1 and 6.04 × 10−6 K−1, respectively. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.'\n",
      " 'The Effect of Carbonate Precursors on the Capacitance Properties of MnCO3MnCO3 is gaining attention of the scientific community as a potential electrode material for supercapacitor applications. It can be easily synthesized by simple, cost effective method using manganese and carbonate precursors. In this article, we report the effect of carbonate precursors on the capacitive storage performance of MnCO3. Carbonate precursors used for the synthesis of MnCO3 were (NH4)HCO3, (NH4)2CO3, K2CO3, Li2CO3, NaHCO3 and Na2CO3. The effect of carbonate precursors on the physico-chemical properties of MnCO3 was studied using powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD), infra-red spectroscopy (IR), surface area analysis, scanning and transmission electron microscopic techniques. PXRD and IR spectral studies revealed that carbonate precursors do not affect the crystal structure. However, they influence significantly the morphology, surface area and porosity of MnCO3 as revealed by morphological and sorption studies. The capacitance properties of MnCO3 were evaluated in an aqueous 0.1 M Mg(ClO4)2 electrolyte. Specific capacitance value of 103, 116, 120, 121, 123 and 141 F g-1 was obtained for MnCO3 synthesized using (NH4)HCO3, (NH4)2CO3, K2CO3, Li2CO3, NaHCO3 and Na2CO3 as carbonate precursor, respectively. Difference in the specific capacitance is attributed to difference in the morphology and other surface properties. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd.'\n",

The high logic density and advancements in architectural features make static random access memory (SRAM)-based FPGAs suitable for complex design implementations. Devices deployed in the nuclear environment face radiation particle strike that causes transient and permanent failures. The major reasons for failures are total ionization dose effects, displacement damage dose effects, and single event effects. Different from the case of space applications, soft errors are the major concern in terrestrial applications. In this article, a review of radiation effects on FPGAs is presented, especially soft errors in SRAM-based FPGAs. Single event upset (SEU) shows a high probability of error in the dependable application development in FPGAs. This survey covers the main sources of radiation and its effects on FPGAs, with emphasis on SEUs as well as on the measurement of radiation upset sensitivity and irradiation experimental results at various facilities.

      " 'Investigation of enhancement in planar fast neutron detector efficiency with stacked structure using Geant4Geant4 based Monte Carlo study has been carried out to assess the improvement in efficiency of the planar structure of Silicon Carbide (SiC)-based semiconductor fast neutron detector with the stacked structure. A proton recoil detector was simulated, which consists of hydrogenous converter, i.e., high-density polyethylene (HDPE) for generating recoil protons by means of neutron elastic scattering (n, p) reaction and semiconductor material SiC, for generating a detectable electrical signal upon transport of recoil protons through it. SiC is considered in order to overcome the various factors associated with conventional Si-based devices such as operability in a harsh radiation environment, as often encountered in nuclear facilities. Converter layer thickness is optimized by considering 109 neutron events of different monoenergetic neutron sources as well as 241Am-Be neutron spectrum. It is found that the optimized thickness for neutron energy range of 1-10 MeV is ~ 400 μm. However, the efficiency of fast neutron detection is estimated to be only 0.112%, which is considered very low for meaningful and reliable detection of neutrons. To overcome this problem, a stacked juxtaposition of converter layer between SiC layers has been analyzed in order to achieve high efficiency. It is noted that a tenfold efficiency improvement has been obtained - 1.04% for 10 layers stacked configuration vis-à-vis 0.112% of single converter layer detector. Further simulation of the stacked detector with respect to variable converter thickness has been performed to achieve the efficiency as high as ~ 3.85% with up to 50 stacks. © 2017 Shanghai Institute of Applied Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Chinese Nuclear Society, Science Press China and Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.'\n",

It is well recognised that the availability of shutdown systems has an important bearing on the plant availability. In this paper, various investigations carried out on the availability of the second shutdown of Indian FBR are reported. The stability of the system performance against a range of anticipated disturbances was studied. Studies were designed to gain better technical insight into the system performance and to aid in finding out the performance bounds.

      " 'The modified exponential time differencing method with IQS model for the neutronic analysis of PHWR transientsA new method of analyzing reactor transients using the modified exponential time differencing method with Improved Quasi Static (IQS) model is developed and presented here. According to this method, the neutron flux is factored into amplitude function and shape function. The amplitude function is solved using the modified exponential time differencing method and the shape function is solved using implicit scheme. Using this method, a large time step can be chosen for solving the amplitude function and the shape function can also be solved by proportionately increasing the time step. This method is applied to estimate the transients in the well known CANDU 3D-PHWR kinetics benchmark, 3D-TWIGL Heterogeneous and 3D Homogeneous Reactors. These reactors contain different kinds of heterogeneities and the reactivity perturbations are also different. The transients in CANDU 3D-PHWR, simulated by LOCA, are estimated by this method for various time steps and the results are compared with other standard methods. From the comparison of results, it is established that this method is capable of estimating the transients using large time steps with good accuracy. A novel scheme to choose the time step for solving the amplitude function under constant and varying reactivity perturbations is also presented and applied here in the estimation of CANDU 3D-PHWR and 3D Homogeneous Reactor transients. It is also shown that by using large time steps, the transient computation time is reduced without affecting the accuracy and the error remains bounded. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd'\n",

The operational characteristics is analyzed regarding criticality, breeding, pin power and burnup distribution. As additional key parameters, the conservation of the safety related feedback effects of the assembly are examined. It is demonstrated that the insertion of 1/3 of fertile fuel rods into the fuel assembly, while the overall Pu content of the assembly is kept constant, can improve the breeding of fresh plutonium. A second proposal is the reduction of the initial Pu content of the assembly which is compensated by eliminating one ring of the fertile blanket around the core. This method proofs to be very efficient to improve the in-core breeding. The consequences on the fuel assembly multiplication factor, the fissile material content, and the pin wise power as well as burnup distribution is analyzed.

      " 'Integrated CFD investigation of heat transfer enhancement using multi-tray core catcher in SFRTo render future SFR more robust and safe, certain BDBE have been considered in the recent years. A Core Disruptive Accident leading to a whole core meltdown scenario has gained the interest of researchers. Various design concepts and safety measures have been suggested and incorporated in design to address such a low probability scenario. A core catcher concept, in particular, has proved to be inevitable as an in-vessel core retention device in SFR for safe retention of core debris arising out after the severe accident. This study aims to analyse the cooling capability of the innovative design concept of core catcher to remove decay heat of degraded core after the accident. First, the capability of single collection tray is established and then the study is extended to two and three collection trays with different design concepts. Transient forms of governing equations of mass, momentum and energy conservations along with k-ε turbulence model are solved by finite volume based CFD solver. Boussinesq approximation is invoked to model buoyancy in sodium. The study shows that a single collection tray is capable of removing up to 20\\xa0MW decay heat load in a typical 500 MWe pool type SFR. Further, studies are carried out to improve the natural circulation of sodium around the source, in the lower plenum and to distribute core debris of the whole core to multiple collection trays. It is found that the double and triple collection trays can accommodate decay loads up to 29\\xa0MW. Provision of openings in the collection trays has proved to be effective in improving the heat transfer and sodium flow as well as in distributing the core debris to the successive plates. Detailed analysis of isotherms and velocity field in the multiple collection trays with openings reveals improved natural circulation in and around the collection trays in the lower plenum. A three tray core catcher device with multiple openings can accommodate the decay heat of whole core meltdown, without exceeding the safe temperature limits of structural material.

      " 'Cooling of small size irradiation specimens using impinging jetsTo study the effect of irradiation on materials, sample coupons are irradiated in cyclotron facilities. During the irradiation process, these samples produce significant amount of heat. This heat needs to be continuously removed from the samples in order to avoid melting of the samples as well as to keep the samples at a particular temperature during the irradiation process. The area available for heat removal is limited due to the small size of the samples. To increase the heat removal rate, jet cooling is employed as it provides large heat transfer co-efficient. To understand the heat transfer characteristics of jet cooling under these conditions, experiments have been carried out. Electric Joule heating is adopted to simulate irradiation heat in stainless steel samples. Circular / slot nozzles are used to create air jet. From the study the values of the parameters correspond to the maximum heat removal rate are found out. The results are also compared with empirical correlations from the literature. © 2017'\n",
      " 'Hydraulic characteristics of a fast reactor fuel subassembly: An experimental investigationFuel subassemblies of a fast reactor consist of fuel pin bundle with helically wound spacer wires, arranged in a triangular pitch within a hexagonal wrapper. The fuel pins are located within the subassembly. Further the subassembly comprises of a diffuser where the cross section changes from cylindrical to hexagonal, mixing plenum before the exit of pin bundle and a specially designed blockage adapter. Accurate assessment of the pressure drop in the fuel subassembly is essential to ensure adequate core cooling and design of sodium pump. Experimental determination of pressure drop characteristics in the subassembly by simulating the hydraulic condition in the subassemblies of the reactor core is considered essential as a better choice as correlations reported in the literature cannot be directly used for all the complex regions present in the subassembly. This is due to the fact that flows in the interconnecting sections are highly under developed. Further, the flow regime in a fuel subassembly varies from laminar (during shutdown heat removal under natural convection) to completely turbulent under full power condition. To understand the hydraulic characteristics of the 500\\xa0MWe Proto type Fast Breeder Reactor (PFBR) fuel subassembly, an experimental facility has been commissioned. Experiments on full scale subassembly with dummy fuel pins have been performed using water as simulant. Experiments have been conducted covering a wide range of Reynolds number encompassing laminar, transition and turbulent regimes. In the rod bundle, no abrupt changes in friction factor were observed when the flow changes from laminar to turbulent. The experimental results have been transposed using Euler number similarity, to determine the pressure drop for sodium flow in the reactor. Possible uncertainties in the experimental data have been quantified. Useful pressure drop correlations have been proposed for various section of the subassembly of a fast breeder reactor. Finally the results for fuel pin bundle region are compared with the data reported in the literature and a satisfactory agreement has been observed. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd'\n",
      " 'Thermal hydraulic parametric investigation of decay heat removal from degraded core of a sodium cooled fast Breeder reactorEnsuring post accident decay heat removal with high degree of reliability following a Core Disruptive Accident (CDA) is very important in the design of sodium cooled fast reactors (SFR). In the recent past, a lot of research has been done towards the design of an in-vessel core catcher below the grid plate to prevent the core debris reaching the main vessel in a pool type SFR. However, during an energetic CDA, the entire core debris is unlikely to reach the core catcher. A significant part of the debris is likely to settle in core periphery between radial shielding subassemblies and the inner vessel. Failure of inner vessel due to the decay heat can lead to core debris reaching the main vessel and threatening its integrity. On the other hand, retention of a part of debris in core periphery can reduce the load on main core catcher. Towards achieving an optimum design of SFR and safety evaluation, it is essential to quantify the amount of heat generating core debris that can be retained safely within the primary vessel. This has been performed by a mathematical simulation comprising solution of 2-D transient form of the governing equations of turbulent sodium flow and heat transfer with Boussinesq approximations. The conjugate conduction-convection model adopted for this purpose is validated against in-house experimental data. Transient evolutions of natural convection in the pools and structural temperatures in critical components have been predicted. It is found that 50% of the core debris can be safely accommodated in the gap between radial shielding subassemblies and inner vessel without exceeding structural temperature limit. It is also established that a single plate core catcher can safely accommodate decay heat arising due to ∼70% of the core debris by establishing natural circulation in the lower sodium pool. The influence of heat removal rate by natural circulation on availability of the number of decay heat exchangers (DHX) dipped in the upper pool is also analyzed. It is seen that the temperatures in the inner vessel, source plate and the maximum debris temperature do not increase significantly even when the DHXs are deployed 5\\xa0h after the accident, demonstrating the benefit of large thermal inertia of the pool. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.'\n",
      " 'An inherently fail-safe electronic logic design for a safety application in nuclear power plantIn this paper, an inherently fail-safe electronic logic circuit is proposed. Further, the logic is investigated for safety critical application in a nuclear power plant with a very low unsafe failure probability requirement. The application involves control circuit for operation of solenoid valves based on the plant state, wherein the de-energization of certain solenoid valves is considered as a safe state. The inherent fail-safeness is achieved by processing the inputs as synchronized pulses rather than static digital levels. Pulse transformers are used at specific locations in the circuit so that energy transition to subsequent stages of the circuit is seized in case of a failure in the previous stage. Such pulse processing is selectively applied to those parts of the circuit for which fail-safe behavior of final control elements is expected. A Failure Mode Effect Analysis (FMEA) is performed for the circuit to systematically ensure that failure of components in postulated modes will result in the fail-safe state. A prototype circuit is built to verify the results obtained from FMEA. The inherency in the circuit is shown to possess a very low unsafe failure probability and quantitatively it is shown. The proposed technique is suggested as a diverse method to control, redundant instrumentation provisions usually provided for safety critical application. This method can be easily extended to similar industrial control involving combinational circuits with modifications. © 2017 Institution of Chemical Engineers'\n",
      " 'Nuclear power plant sensor fault detection using singular value decomposition-based methodIn a nuclear power plant, periodic sensor calibration is necessary to ensure the correctness of measurements. Those sensors which have gone out of calibration can lead to malfunction of the plant, possibly causing a loss in revenue or damage to equipment. Continuous sensor status monitoring is desirable to assure smooth running of the plant and reduce maintenance costs associated with unnecessary manual sensor calibrations. In this paper, a method is proposed to detect and identify any degradation of sensor performance. The validation process consists of two steps: (i) residual generation and (ii) fault detection by residual evaluation. Singular value decomposition (SVD) and Euclidean distance (ED) methods are used to generate the residual and evaluate the fault on the residual space, respectively. This paper claims that SVD-based fault detection method is better than the well-known principal component analysis-based method. The method is validated using data from fast breeder test reactor. © 2017, Indian Academy of Sciences.'\n",

      " 'Delineating the role of ripples on the thermal expansion of 2D honeycomb materials: Graphene, 2D h-BN and monolayer (ML)-MoS2We delineated the role of thermally excited ripples on the thermal expansion properties of 2D honeycomb materials (free-standing graphene, 2D h-BN, and ML-MoS2), by explicitly carrying out three-dimensional (3D) and two-dimensional (2D) molecular dynamics simulations. In 3D simulations, the in-plane lattice parameter (a-lattice) of graphene and 2D h-BN shows thermal contraction over a wide range of temperatures and exhibits a strong system size dependence. The 2D simulations of the very same system show a reverse trend, where the a-lattice expands in the whole computed temperature range. In contrast to graphene and 2D h-BN, the a-lattice of ML-MoS2 shows thermal expansion in both 2D and 3D simulations and their system size dependence is marginal. By analyzing the phonon dispersion at 300 K, we found that the discrepancy between 2D and 3D simulations of graphene and 2D h-BN is due to the absence of out-of-plane bending modes (ZA) in 2D simulations, which is responsible for the thermal contraction of the a-lattice at low temperature. Meanwhile, all the phonon modes are present in the 2D phonon dispersion of ML-MoS2, which indicates that the origin of the ZA mode is not purely due to the out-of-plane movement of atoms and also its effect on thermal expansion is not significant as found in graphene and 2D h-BN. © 2017 the Owner Societies.'\n",
      " 'Local inversion symmetry breaking and spin-phonon coupling in the perovskite GdCrO3Our detailed temperature-dependent synchrotron powder x-ray diffraction studies along with first-principles density-functional-theory-based calculations enable us to shed light on the origin of ferroelectricity in GdCrO3. The actual lattice symmetry is found to be the noncentrosymmetric orthorhombic Pna21 structure, supporting the polar nature of the system. Polar distortion is associated with the Gd displacements with respect to the oxygen cage. Our study reveals an intimate analogy between GdCrO3 and YCrO3. However, a distinctive difference exists because Gd is less displacive than Y, which results in an orthorhombic Pna21 structure in GdCrO3 in contrast to the monoclinic P21 structure in YCrO3 and, consequently, decreases its polar property. It is found that magnetic coupling between Gd 4f and Cr 3d plays an important role in ferroelectric distortion.

In addition, the scattering efficiency also plays an important role in improving signal enhancement and contrast of the spectroscopic imaging of nanostructures by scattering of light. We report the effect of scattering efficiency in the Raman intensity enhancement, and contrast generation in near-field tip-enhanced Raman spectroscopic (TERS) imaging of one-dimensional inorganic crystalline nanostructures of Si and AlN having large variation in polarizability change. The Raman enhancement of pure covalently bonded Si nanowire (NW) is found to be 2 orders of higher in magnitude for the TERS imaging, as compared to that of AlN nanotip (NT) having a higher degree of ionic bonding, suggesting the importance of scattering efficiency of the materials in TERS imaging. The strong contrast generation due to higher signal enhancement in TERS imaging of Si NW also helped in achieving the better resolved spectroscopic images than that of the AlN NT.

The performance of supercapacitors depends on the electrode material, type of electrolyte, and interaction between them. Owing to the beneficial interconnected porous structure with multiple conducting channels, vertical graphene nanosheets (VGN) have proved to be leading supercapacitor electrode materials. Herein, we demonstrate a novel approach based on the combination of surface activation and a new organo-aqueous hybrid electrolyte, tetraethylammonium tetrafluoroborate in H2SO4, to achieve significant enhancement in supercapacitor performance of VGN. As-synthesized VGN exhibits an excellent supercapacitance of 0.64 mF/cm2 in H2SO4. However, identification of a novel electrolyte for performance enhancement is the subject of current research. The present manuscript demonstrates the potential of the hybrid electrolyte in enhancing the areal capacitance (1.99 mF/cm2) with excellent retention (only 5.4% loss after 5000 cycles) and Coulombic efficiency (93.1%). In addition, a five-fold enhancement in the capacitance of VGNs (0.64 to 3.31 mF/cm2) with a reduced internal resistance is achieved by the combination of KOH activation and the hybrid electrolyte. © 2017 Author(s).'\n",

Here, we report the correlation between mixed as well as preferentially oriented samarium doped cerium oxide electrolyte films fabricated by varying the substrate temperatures (100, 300 and 500 °C) over anode/quartz by electron beam physical vapor deposition. Pole figure analysis of films deposited at 300 °C demonstrated a preferential (111) orientation in out-off plane direction, while a mixed orientation was observed at 100 and 500 °C. As per extended structural zone model, the growth mechanism of film differs with surface mobility of adatom. Preferential orientation resulted in higher ionic conductivity than the films with mixed orientation, demonstrating the role of growth on electrochemical properties. The superior ionic conductivity upon preferential orientation arises from the effective reduction of anisotropic nature and grain boundary density in highly oriented thin films in out-of-plane direction, which facilitates the hopping of oxygen ion at a lower activation energy. This unique feature of growing an oriented electrolyte over the anode material opens a new approach to solving the grain boundary limitation and makes it as a promising solution for efficient power generation. © 2017 The Author(s).'\n",
      " 'Duality and quantum state engineering in cavity arraysA system of two coupled cavities with N - 1 photons is shown to be dynamically equivalent to an array of N coupled cavities containing one photon. Every transition in the two cavity system has a dual phenomenon in terms of photon transport in the cavity array. This duality is employed to arrive at the required coupling strengths and nonlinearities in the cavity array so that controlled photon transfer is possible between any two cavities. This transfer of photons between two of the cavities in the array is effected without populating the other cavities. The condition for perfect transport enables perfect state transfer between any two cavities in the array. Further, possibility of high fidelity generation of generalized NOON states in two coupled cavities, which are dual to the Bell states of the photon in the cavity array, is established. © 2017 The Author(s).'\n",

It is found that surface oxygen related defects could be tuned by varying the fluence of the SHIs. Durability tests show that the SHI induced surface oxygen-deficient ZnO NRs have the stable superhydrophobic behavior for more than a year. © 2017 The Author(s).'\n",
      " 'A Study on Doped Heterojunctions in TiO2 Nanotubes: An Efficient Photocatalyst for Solar Water SplittingThe two important factors that affect sunlight assisted water splitting ability of TiO2 are its charge recombination and large band gap. We report the first demonstration of nitrogen doped triphase (anatase-rutile-brookite) TiO2 nanotubes as sun light active photocatalyst for water splitting with high quantum efficiency. Nitrogen doped triphase TiO2 nanotubes, corresponding to different nitrogen concentrations, are synthesized electrochemically. Increase in nitrogen concentration in triphase TiO2 nanotubes is found to induce brookite to anatase phase transformation. The variation in density of intra-band states (Ti3+ and N 2p states) with increase in nitrogen doping are found to be critical in tuning the photocatalytic activity of TiO2 nanotubes. The presence of bulk heterojunctions in single nanotube of different nitrogen doped TiO2 samples is confirmed from HRTEM analysis. The most active nitrogen doped triphase TiO2 nanotubes are found to be 12 times efficient compared to pristine triphase TiO2, for solar hydrogen generation. The band alignment and charge transfer pathways in nitrogen doped TiO2 with triphase heterojunctions are delineated. Bulk heterojunctions among the three phases present in the nanotubes with intra-band defect states is shown to enhance the photocatalytic activity tremendously. Our study also confirms the theory that three phase system is efficient in photocatalysis compared to two phase system. © 2017 The Author(s).'\n",
      " 'Nanoscale investigation of enhanced electron field emission for silver ion implanted/post-annealed ultrananocrystalline diamond filmsSilver (Ag) ions are implanted in ultrananocrystalline diamond (UNCD) films to enhance the electron field emission (EFE) properties, resulting in low turn-on field of 8.5 V/μm with high EFE current density of 6.2 mA/cm2 (at an applied field of 20.5 V/μm). Detailed nanoscale investigation by atomic force microscopy based peak force-controlled tunneling atomic force microscopy (PF-TUNA) and ultra-high vacuum scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) based current imaging tunneling spectroscopy (CITS) reveal that the UNCD grain boundaries are the preferred electron emission sites. The two scanning probe microscopic results supplement each other well. However, the PF-TUNA measurement is found to be better for explaining the local electron emission behavior than the STM-based CITS technique. The formation of Ag nanoparticles induced abundant sp2 nanographitic phases along the grain boundaries facilitate the easy transport of electrons and is believed to be a prime factor in enhancing the conductivity/EFE properties of UNCD films. The nanoscale understanding on the origin of electron emission sites in Ag-ion implanted/annealed UNCD films using the scanning probe microscopic techniques will certainly help in developing high-brightness electron sources for flat-panel displays applications. © 2017 The Author(s).'\n",
      " 'Quantum size effect on the heat capacity of nickel nanolatticeNearly exponentially decaying heat capacity was observed exceptionally in a well-characterized naturally assembled hexagonal closed packed lattice of 4.0 nm nickel nanoparticles (NPs). It was also associated with quantum jumps. These were however not observed in other NP sizes and have negligible effects of high magnetic fields. Magnetic susceptibilities in contrast revealed the evolution of quantum size effects with a decrease in particle size. They exhibited sharp rise below about 30 K and vestiges of saturations below 5 K. The sharp rise was explained by Curie-like characteristics of odd electrons, while the saturations tend towards the orthogonal even-like case. © 2017 Author(s).'\n",
      " 'High pressure Raman spectroscopic study of low thermal expansion AZr2(PO4)3, A=K, Rb and CsAZr2(PO4)3 (A=K, Rb, Cs) are a set of flexible framework compounds that exhibit tunable ultralow thermal expansion over the wide temperature range of 293-1273 K. High pressure Raman spectroscopic measurements on AZr2(PO4)3 reveals structural phase transformation above 2 GPa and amorphization above 20 GPa. On decompression from 20 GPa, the amorphous phase remains unchanged indicating irreversible nature of pressure induced amorphization (PIA). Various low frequency Raman modes corresponding to translation of Zr atoms and coupled rotation of PO4 tetrahedra and ZrO6 octahedra soften with increase in pressure which could be the driving force for the observed phase transition. Pressure induced phase transition could be due to collapse of Zr-O-P bond angles, and PIA due to kinetic hindrance of equilibrium decomposition. We have compared the phase transition and amorphization pressures of the various members of AZr2(PO4)3 to account for the stability of the ambient rhombohedral phase. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.'\n",
      " 'High pressure Raman spectroscopic studies on ultrananocrystalline diamond thin films: Anharmonicity and thermal properties of the grain boundaryUltrananocrystalline diamond (UNCD) thin film has been attracted widely to scientific community due to its attractive thermal and mechanical properties. Herein, we report the high-pressure behavior of grain boundary (GB) originated phonon modes and their correlation with thermal properties in UNCD film grown by microwave plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition method. Spherical ultranano grains with size 3–4 nm in these films were investigated by high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM). Raman spectroscopic studies of UNCD with a pressure transmitting medium (up to 16 GPa) and uniaxial pressure (up to 28 GPa) revealed the presence of grain boundary phonons which are found to harden upon compression. GB phonons contribution to the specific heat of UNCD at room temperature is estimated to be 4.7314 J/mol-K, which is ~ 80% of the reported theoretical molar specific heat Cv value (5.568 J/mol-K). Using our experimentally obtained mode Grüneisen parameters, GB contribution to the thermal expansion coefficient of UNCD is estimated to be 0.5 × 10− 6 K− 1. Grain boundaries of UNCD are found to be highly stable and Raman spectra showed reversible behavior upon release of pressure. Phonon spectra as a function of temperature down to 90 K were used to obtain the anharmonicity of GB phonon modes. The first order temperature coefficient of trans-polyacetylene modes (ν1 ν2 and ν3) and E2g in-plane (G-band) modes of GB are obtained as − 0.38 × 10− 2, 1.69 × 10− 2, − 1.55 × 10− 2 and − 1.41 × 10− 2 cm− 1 K− 1, respectively. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.'\n",

      " 'VO2 microcrystals as an advanced smart window material at semiconductor to metal transitionTextured VO2(0 1 1) microcrystals are grown in the monoclinic, M1 phase which undergoes a reversible first order semiconductor to metal transition (SMT) accompanied by a structural phase transition to rutile tetragonal, R phase. Around the phase transition, VO2 also experiences noticeable change in its optical and electrical properties. A change in color of the VO2 micro crystals from white to cyan around the transition temperature is observed, which is further understood by absorption of red light using temperature dependent ultraviolet-visible spectroscopic analysis and photoluminescence studies. The absorption of light in the red region is explained by the optical transition between Hubbard states, confirming the electronic correlation as the driving force for SMT in VO2. The thermochromism in VO2 has been studied for smart window applications so far in the IR region, which supports the opening of the band gap in semiconducting phase; whereas there is hardly any report in the management of visible light. The filtering of blue light along with reflection of infrared above the semiconductor to metal transition temperature make VO2 applicable as advanced smart windows for overall heat management of a closure. © 2017 IOP Publishing Ltd.'\n",

Herein, the present study deals with plasmonic assisted emission properties of Au NPs-vertical graphene (VG) hybrid nanostructures. The influence of effective polarizability of Au NPs on the surface enhanced Raman scattering and luminescence properties is investigated. In addition, a remarkable infra-red emission in the hybrid nanostructures is observed and interpreted on the basis of intra-band transitions in Au NPs. The flake-like nanoporous VG structure is invoked for the generation of additional confined photons to impart additional momentum and a gradient of confined excitation energy towards initiating the intra-band transitions of Au NPs. Integrating Au plasmonic materials in three-dimensional VG nanostructures enhances the light-matter interactions.

      " 'Hydrogen adsorption on single walled carbon nanotubes-tungsten trioxide compositeIn this work, hydrogen storage property of single walled carbon nanotubes-tungsten trioxide (SWCNTs-WO3) composite is investigated. The composite is prepared and hydrogenated by electron beam (e-beam) evaporation technique. Hydrogenation is carried out during the preparation of the composite itself. The amount of hydrogen uptake by the composite is 2.7 wt%, which is due to the collective adsorption of hydrogen by CNTs and WO3 nanostructured materials, the method of preparation and hydrogenation involved. The incorporated hydrogen is completely (100%) released in the temperature range of 175–305 °C which in turn infers that the hydrogenated composite is stable at room temperature. The stored hydrogen has the average binding energy of 0.4 eV and the nature of binding is found to be weak chemisorption.

While a pressure induced reversible structural phase transition from tetragonal to orthorhombic structure is observed at ∼6.3 GPa in Fe2B, FeB has been found to be stable in its orthorhombic phase up to the pressure of 24 GPa. In the case of Fe2B, both parent and daughter phases coexist beyond the transition pressure. The bulk modulus of FeB and Fe2B (tetragonal) have been found to be 248 GPa and 235 GPa respectively. First principle electronic structure calculations have been performed using the present experimental inputs and the calculated ground state properties agree quite well with the major findings of the experiments.

      " 'Scalable transfer of vertical graphene nanosheets for flexible supercapacitor applicationsVertical graphene nanosheets (VGN) are the material of choice for application in next-generation electronic devices. The growing demand for VGN-based flexible devices for the electronics industry brings in restriction on VGN growth temperature. The difficulty associated with the direct growth of VGN on flexible substrates can be overcome by adopting an effective strategy of transferring the well-grown VGN onto arbitrary flexible substrates through a soft chemistry route. In the present study, we report an inexpensive and scalable technique for the polymer-free transfer of VGN onto arbitrary substrates without disrupting its morphology, structure, and properties. After transfer, the morphology, chemical structure, and electrical properties are analyzed by scanning electron microscopy, Raman spectroscopy, x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and four-probe resistive methods, respectively. The wetting properties are studied from the water contact angle measurements. The observed results indicate the retention of morphology, surface chemistry, structure, and electronic properties. Furthermore, the storage capacity of the transferred VGN-based binder-free and current collector-free flexible symmetric supercapacitor device is studied. A very low sheet resistance of 670 Ω/□ and excellent supercapacitance of 158 μF cm-2 with 86% retention after 10 000 cycles show the prospect of the damage-free VGN transfer approach for the fabrication of flexible nanoelectronic devices. © 2017 IOP Publishing Ltd.'\n",

The non-polar orthorhombic structure exhibits a subtle, irreversible transformation into the ferroelectric monoclinic-II (m-II) phase above ~\\xa0421\\xa0K. At a slightly higher temperature of 426\\xa0K this m-II (P21) phase reversibly transforms into a disordered, paraelectric monoclinic-I (P21/m) structure. We synthesized DIPAB in the orthorhombic structure, heated it to obtain the m-II phase and carried out a systematic study of their Raman and IR spectra. We obtained the phonon irreducible representations from factor group analysis of the orthorhombic and m-II structures based on the reported structural information. DIPAB is an organic molecular crystal, and the vibrational spectra in the intramolecular region (200–3500\\xa0cm−\\xa01) of the two different phases are identical to each other, indicating weak inter-molecular interactions in both crystalline structures. In the low wavenumber region (10–150\\xa0cm−\\xa01) the Raman spectra of the two phases are different due to their sensitivity to molecular environment. We also carried out first principles calculations using Gaussian 09 and CASTEP codes to analyze the vibrational frequencies.

The study has been done up to 23 GPa at ambient temperature with methanol-ethanol-water (MEW) as pressure transmitting medium. The hexagonal lattice has been found to be stable in the pressure range studied. The isothermal bulk modulus is estimated to be 333(6) GPa by employing 3rd order Birch-Murnaghan equation of state. The obtained high value of bulk modulus is understood in terms of band filling effect, and the nature of bonding between B-B and Ti-B in TiB2. Compressibility along 'a' and 'c' axis is found to be anisotropic with compressibility values of 0.93(2) TPa-1 and 1.14(2) TPa-1 respectively. From the estimated bond lengths for Ti-B and B-B it is found that B-B bonds are less compressible compared to Ti-B bonds which is in accordance with the respective nature of Ti-B and B-B bonds. A change in the rate of bond contraction was seen around 12 GPa which is due to the bond hardening for both Ti-B and B-B bonds with pressure. © 2017 IOP Publishing Ltd.\"\n",

The temperature dependent resistivity shows an upturn at T andlt; 200 K due to localization behaviour at low temperatures. Magneto-conductance (MC) measurements at various temperatures from 3 K to 200 K were done in a magnetic field up to ±15 T applied parallel and perpendicular to the substrate. MC curves clearly show a sharp cusp like behaviour due to the weak-localization phenomenon and are fitted with Hikami-Larkin-Nagaoka equation (HLN). The phase coherence length deduced from the fit shows a decreasing behaviour with increasing temperature. The plot of phase coherence time (τφ) with T-1 shows a linear behaviour from 10 K down to 3 K denoting that the electron-electron interaction is the prime de-phase mechanism in the sample. The carrier density and mobility deduced from Hall measurements did not vary with temperatures which further substantiate that the interaction of the electrons in GaN nanowall plays a major role in the quantum correction. © 2017 IOP Publishing Ltd.'\n",
      " 'Sub-diffusive dynamics and two-step yielding in dense thermo-responsive microgel glassesWe have prepared dense colloidal suspensions of thermo-responsive poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) (PNIPAM) microgel particles with different volume fractions by subjecting the particles to different amounts of osmotic compression. Structural ordering and dynamics have been investigated using light scattering and yielding behaviour by oscillatory rheology. At room temperature, suspensions have found to exhibit a glassy state with the microgel particle size to be smaller than that determined under dilute conditions (i.e. deswelling of particles under osmotic compression). Quite interestingly, we observed (a) sub-diffusive mean square displacement (MSD) at short times and (b) two-step yielding (i.e. loss modulus, G, exhibiting two peaks as a function of shear strain amplitude, γo) in the glassy state. These findings are interpreted in terms of the overlap of dangling polymer chains between shells of the neighbouring PNIPAM microgel particles which are known to have a core-shell structure. At elevated temperatures, the two-step yielding behaviour of the glasses has been observed to change into a single-step yielding. With further increase in temperature, it has been found that PNIPAM microgel glasses melt into a liquid-like order and the behaviour of MSD changes from sub-diffusive to diffusive type. The results are discussed in light of those reported for attractive and repulsive colloidal glasses. © 2017, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany.'\n",

The removal efficiency of 95% for RB dye in 60\\xa0min evidences the superior degradation capability of highly porous LaMnO3 particles. The photocatalytic activity not only depends on porous structure, but also strongly based on crystallinity, and specific surface area of LaMnO3 particles.

      " 'Tribofilm formation in ultrananocrystalline diamond filmFriction and wear properties of ultrananocrystalline diamond (UNCD) films are found to be superior, and therefore it could be useful for various applications. However, understanding of the tribological properties with respect to boundary phase composition in this material is not yet well understood. Here, the grain boundary phases such as graphite and amorphous carbon (a-C) of UNCD films were tailored during the chemical vapor deposition process by altering the Argon and Nitrogen gases in CH4 plasma medium. The significance of these grain boundary phases in UNCD film was discussed to explain the tribological properties. In run-in, friction coefficient was high in UNCDAr film deposited in CH4 (1%)/Ar plasma condition and it was decreased to lower value after longer sliding distance. However, ultrahigh wear resistance of this film was observed. Here, graphite and a-C phases were insignificant in the grain boundary region as evident from high resolution transmission electron microscope (HRTEM). Further, chemical bonding of these phases was quantitatively described by electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS). In contrast, ultralow value of friction coefficient with significantly shorter run-in high friction regime was observed in UNCDN film deposited in CH4 (6%)/N2 plasma. Such a unique characteristic was described by the nanographite phase encasing the needle-like diamond grain of UNCDN film, forming core-shell granular structure. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) showed nucleation of two dimensional (2D) nanographite particles in the deformed wear track after run-in. This was possible due to the presence of core-shell granular structure in UNCDN film. Graphitic nature of the shell for needle-like diamond grains in the wear track was investigated by micro-Raman spectroscopy. Moreover, graphite and a-C tribofilm phase in the wear track was investigated by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) having spatial resolution micrometer scale. Needle-like diamond grains and graphite phase of tribofilm could be one of the primary reasons for the marked reduction in the friction coefficient. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.'\n",

The compositional variations on their surface as well as at a depth of 50\\xa0nm beneath the surface are presented and discussed. The temperature of the substrate was varied as room temperature (RT), 100\\xa0°C and 500\\xa0°C. The binding energy of Al-2p, N-1s and O-1s core level electrons indicated formation of 2H polytypoid of AlN. The increase in concentration of AlN with substrate temperature during deposition is elucidated through a detailed analysis of calculated elemental atomic concentrations (at. %) of all possible phases present at the film surface as well as beneath the surface. Our results show predominant formation of AlN as high as 74.0\\xa0at. % on the surface and 89.0\\xa0at. % at a depth of 50\\xa0nm beneath the surface is achieved by using the substrate temperature as a deposition process variable.

      " 'Effect of demagnetization factor on the magnetocaloric property of ErMnO3Isothermal magnetization measurements were performed on a square cuboid shaped polycrystalline ErMnO3 sample with a field applied along different directions, having different demagnetization factor values. The magnetocaloric property, namely the isothermal magnetic entropy change (ΔSM), is evaluated from the magnetization data with and without demagnetization factor correction. The results indicate that without demagnetization factor correction the ΔSM values are slightly underestimated. The difference between ΔSM (T) values with and without demagnetization factor correction increases with an increase in demagnetization factor. However, as the field increases, the variation/error in ΔSM values due to uncertainties related to magnetization (M), field (H) and temperature (T) values becomes higher due to the demagnetization factor correction. © 2017 IOP Publishing Ltd Printed in the UK.'\n",

The thermal variation of structural parameters, structural anisotropy, Debye temperature, velocity of sound, and isothermal compressibility of Sb2Te3-xSex at room temperature are estimated. Analysis revealed that structural anisotropy and phonon anharmonicity are correlated. Further, lattice thermal conductivities (κL), evaluated in the Umklapp scattering limit in terms of γG, indicate that the phonon anharmonicity increasing with Se(x) content reduces κL.

Here, we report on the effect of the key process parameters such as deposition temperature, discharge power and distance from plasma source to substrate on the catalyst-free growth of VGNs in microwave plasmas. A direct evidence for the initiation of vertical growth through nanoscale graphitic islands is obtained from the temperature-dependent growth rates where the activation energy is found to be as low as 0.57 eV. It is shown that the growth rate and the structural quality of the films could be enhanced by (a) increasing the substrate temperature, (b) decreasing the distance between the microwave plasma source and the substrate, and (c) increasing the discharge power. The correlation between the wetting characteristics, morphology and structural quality is established. It is also demonstrated that morphology, crystallinity, wettability and sheet resistance of the VGNs can be varied while maintaining the same sp3 content in the film. The effects of the substrate temperature and the electric field in vertical alignment of the graphene sheets are reported. These findings help to develop and optimize the process conditions to produce VGNs tailored for applications including sensing, field emission, catalysis and energy storage. © 2017 Ghosh et al.'\n",
      " 'Suppression of Baseline Wander Artifact in Magnetocardiogram Using Breathing SensorMeasurements of magnetocardiogram (MCG) are commonly contaminated by different types of artifacts like breathing, power line interference and subject’s movement, out of which artifact due to breathing is unavoidable. This breathing artifact is mainly caused by movement of the chest of the subject during respiration and the consequent changes of the distance between the superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) sensors (used for recording the MCG signal) and the subject (lying in a supine position under the cryostat housing the SQUID sensors); because of this, the measured MCG signal is a superposition of the true MCG signal of cardiac origin and the breathing related artifact. In most previous works, the suppression of baseline wander artifact was implemented by using digital filters, wavelet based technique, empirical mode decomposition (EMD) and ensemble empirical mode decomposition (EEMD). We present here a novel approach for effective suppression of breathing related baseline wander artifacts by acquiring the MCG data contaminated by the breathing artifact simultaneously with the experimental recording of the actual breathing pattern of the subject using a temperature sensor. The temperature sensor monitors the very slight change in temperature that occurs near the nostril during inhalation and exhalation, and this data is used for the subsequent elimination of the breathing artifact from the contaminated MCG by using the regression approach. We illustrate the method and compare its performance with other conventional approaches for the suppression of baseline wander in the measurement of MCG using single channel data. This is the first time that a breathing sensor has been employed for the suppression of breathing related baseline wander artifact. Experimental results reveal the superiority of the proposed approach in suppression of the breathing related base-line wander artifact with the important advantage that the algorithm used for the suppression uses the actual breathing data derived from an experimental input. © 2017, Taiwanese Society of Biomedical Engineering.'\n",
      " 'Surface optical phonon modes in hexagonal shaped Al0.97Ga0.03N nanostructuresRaman modes of plasma assisted molecular beam epitaxy grown, c-plane oriented and hexagonal shaped cylindrical Al0.97Ga0.03N nanostructures are reported. Apart from the group theoretically allowed optical phonons at zone center (wave vector, q\\xa0=\\xa00), two additional phonon modes around 763 and 846\\xa0cm−1 are observed in between the reported values of longitudinal optical (LOq=0) and transverse optical (TOq=0) phonon modes. The observed phonon mode frequencies are matched with the simulated dispersion curve for the surface optical (SO) phonon modes and subsequently assigned as SO(A1) and SO(E1) with A1 and E1 symmetries, respectively. A change in the dielectric constant of the surrounding medium using CCl4 is demonstrated to show a significant red shift of the additional modes with respect to those in air, and they show good agreement with the calculated SO phonon frequencies. The origin of SO phonon modes are attributed to the relaxation of Raman selection rules away from the Brillouin zone centre because of the presence of periodic surface modulations of sharp edges at the corners of well-faceted Al0.97Ga0.03N hexagonal crystallites in the sample. An appropriate quantification is also made in this regard to find out the Fourier component of the surface potential responsible for activating the SO mode. © 2017, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany.'\n",
      " 'Atomic layer deposition of nanocrystallite arrays of copper(I) chloride for optoelectronic structuresZinc blende structure γ-copper(I) chloride is a wide bandgap semiconductor with high exciton and biexciton binding energies. γ-CuCl has applications in UV-wavelength optoelectronic structures which can exploit these characteristics, such as 4-wave mixing and optical bistability. For these purposes, a controllable method of achieving thin films and nanocrystallite arrays is necessary. Atomic layer deposition (ALD) of nanocrystallites and thin films of γ-CuCl under restricted conditions has previously been demonstrated. This paper greatly extends the previous work and unequivocally confirms that ALD growth takes place over a range of deposition parameters, as characterised by growth saturation with increasing precursor dose, deposition rate independent of temperature and linear growth rate once a complete film has been formed. Arrays of nanocrystallites of different sizes can be controllably deposited by varying the number of ALD cycles within the initial nucleation region. In this region two distinct growth regimes have been observed depending on the length of the post-chloride precursor purge pulse. Long purge time results in retarded nucleation whereas short pulse time shows enhanced nucleation compared to a strictly linear process. The zinc blende γ-CuCl phase was confirmed with both X-ray analysis and also the signature excitonic Z1,2 and Z3 peaks in optical absorption, with no evidence of other impurities. This demonstrates that ALD is a suitable technique for the controllable deposition of thin films and arrays of nanocrystallites of CuCl which may facilitate the use of CuCl in thin film or nanocluster form for further exploration in optoelectronic and photonic applications. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media New York.'\n",
      " \"Structure and electron field emission properties of ion beam reduced graphene oxide sheetsWe report the structure and electron field emission properties of ion beam reduced graphene oxide (GO). 500 keV Ar+ ion beam was used to reduce the GO, synthesized by modified Hummer's method. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and Resonant Rutherford backscattering spectrometric analyses evidenced that the oxygen functional groups drastically reduced upon irradiation. Further, the ion beam reduced GO exhibits enhanced electron field emission property. The exponential reduction of oxygen concentration is correlated with the field enhancement factor. Raman studies shows that ion irradiation process does not introduced any additional defects in GO. Scanning electron microscopic analysis reveals layered structure of GO sheets upon ion irradiation.

      " 'Role of temperature in the radiation stability of yttria stabilized zirconia under swift heavy ion irradiation: A study from the perspective of nuclear reactor applicationsThe search for materials that can withstand the harsh radiation environments of the nuclear industry has become an urgent challenge in the face of ever-increasing demands for nuclear energy. To this end, polycrystalline yttria stabilized zirconia (YSZ) pellets were irradiated with 80 MeV Ag6+ ions to investigate their radiation tolerance against fission fragments. To better simulate a nuclear reactor environment, the irradiations were carried out at the typical nuclear reactor temperature (850 °C). For comparison, irradiations were also performed at room temperature. Grazing incidence X-ray diffraction and Raman spectroscopy measurements reveal degradation in crystallinity for the room temperature irradiated samples. No bulk structural amorphization was however observed, whereas defect clusters were formed as indicated by transmission electron microscopy and supported by thermal spike simulation results. A significant reduction of the irradiation induced defects/damage, i.e., improvement in the radiation tolerance, was seen under irradiation at 850 C. This is attributed to the fact that the rapid thermal quenching of the localized hot molten zones (arising from spike in the lattice temperature upon irradiation) is confined to 850 C (i.e., attributed to the resistance inflicted on the rapid thermal quenching of the localized hot molten zones by the high temperature of the environment) thereby resulting in the reduction of the defects/damage produced. Our results present strong evidence for the applicability of YSZ as an inert matrix fuel in nuclear reactors, where competitive effects of radiation damage and dynamic thermal healing mechanisms may lead to a strong reduction in the damage production and thus sustain its physical integrity. © 2017 Author(s).'\n",
      " 'Physicochemical properties of nanocomposite: Hydroxyapatite in reduced graphene oxideGraphene oxide (GO) based nanocomposites have gained considerable attention in the field of material science due to their excellent physicochemical and biological properties. Incorporation of nanomaterials into GO sheets prevents the formation of π–π stacking bond thereby giving rise to composites that show the improved properties compared to their individual counterparts. In this work, reduced graphene oxide (rGO) - hydroxyapatite (HAP) nanocomposites were synthesized by ultrasonic method. Increasing the c/a ratio of HAP in the diffraction pattern of rGO/HAP nanocomposites indicates the c-axis oriented grown HAP nanorods interacting with rGO layers. Shift in wavenumber (15\\xa0cm−\\xa01) and increase of full width at half maximum (45\\xa0cm−\\xa01) of G band in Raman spectra of the rGO/HAP nanocomposites are observed and attributed to the tensile strain induced due to the intercalated HAP nanorods between the rGO layers. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) and phase imaging studies revealed the intercalation of HAP nanorod with diameter 30\\xa0nm and length 110–120\\xa0nm in rGO sheets was clearly perceived along with improved elasticity compared to pristine HAP. 13C-NMR results proved the synergistic interaction between both components in rGO/HAP nanocomposite.

The films which are deposited on silicon substrates (Si(100)) consisted of layered structures with sharp edges as observed under the scanning electron microscope (SEM). The formation of mixed phases of tetragonal and orthorhombic phases of V2O5 was confirmed using glancing incidence X-ray diffraction (GIXRD). The crystal purity and layered structure was further confirmed using Raman spectroscopy. Gas sensing experiments were performed in an in-house designed and custom built gas exposure facility. It was found that the films were selective towards detection of nitrogen dioxide (NO2 with respect to ammonia (NH3 at low operating temperatures of around 50 C which is suitable for near room temperature applications.

      " 'Polydimethyl siloxane based nanocomposites with antibiofilm properties for biomedical applicationsPolydimethyl siloxane (PDMS) is an excellent implant material for biomedical applications, but often fails as it is prone to microbial colonization which forms biofilms. In the present study CuO, CTAB capped CuO, and ZnO nanoparticles were tested as nanofillers to enhance the antibiofilm property of PDMS against Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli. In general S. aurues (Gram positive and more hydrophobic) favor PDMS surface than glass while E. coli (Gram negative and more hydrophilic) behaves in a reverse way. Incorporation of nanofillers renders the PDMS surface antibacterial and reduces the attachment of both bacteria. These surfaces are also not cytotoxic nor show any cell damage. Contact angle of the material and the cell surface hydrophobicity influenced the extent of bacterial attachment. Cell viability in biofilms was dependent on the antimicrobial property of the nanoparticles incorporated in the PDMS matrix. Simple regression relationships were able to predict the bacterial attachment and number of dead cells on these nanocomposites. Among the nanocomposites tested, PDMS incorporated with CTAB (cetyl trimethylammonium bromide)-capped CuO appears to be the best antibacterial material with good cyto-compatibility. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

      " 'Highly sensitive, atmospheric pressure operatable sensor based on Au nanoclusters decorated TiO2@Au heterojunction nanorods for trace level NO2 gas detectionA controlled synthetic strategy is established for the development of TiO2@Au heterojunction nanorods using a facile wet-chemical method for the detection of NO2 gas under atmospheric pressure conditions. Structural studies reveal the existence of metastable anatase phase along with thermodynamically stable rutile phase with high degree of crystallinity. The structural analysis divulges the uniform surface anchoring of Au nanoclusters onto mono-dispersed TiO2 nanorods introducing interfacial metal–semiconductor heterojunctions. TiO2@Au heterojunction nanorods exhibited excellent sensor performance towards trace level exposure of NO2 gas. Owing to the interfacial electron transfer process at the heterojunction the optimum operating temperature of TiO2@Au heterojunction nanorods determined to be 250 °C, which is much less as compared to pristine TiO2 gas sensors (400 °C). Sensor response was found to be linear for the trace level concentration range of 0.5–5\\xa0ppm with lowest detection limit as 500\\xa0ppb. The TiO2@Au heterojunction nanorods exhibited higher sensitivity at atmospheric pressure conditions compared to vacuum conditions because of the changes in surface O2 adsorption properties of the heterojunction material at different oxygen partial pressure and existence of mixed phases in TiO2 nanorods. The superior gas sensor performance of the material under atmospheric pressure conditions point towards their potential for real-time applications. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media New York.'\n",
      " 'Optical and rheological studies on weak gel-sol transition in aqueous solutions of poly(N-isopropylacrylamide)-block-polystyreneThe optical and rheological properties of aqueous solutions of block copolymer composed of low molecular weight poly(N-isopropylacrylamide)-b-polystyrene are studied as a function of temperature. From light scattering measurements the block copolymer solution is found to form micelles at very low concentrations and the critical micellar concentration is identified as 0.005 wt%. Apart from the concentration dependence, a unique temperature dependent micelle formation is noted at 34°C. Further, temperature dependent refractive index measurements shows that the refractive index increases with temperature (beyond the lower critical solution temperature, 31.6°C of the polymer), and is attributed to the stable rearrangement of the proximal hydrophobic isopropyl-polystyrene chains in the collapsed polymer so as to overcome the steric hindrance effects offered by the hydrophobic chains. In the polymer concentrations investigated for rheological studies, the solution flows, yet manifested solid like behavior with G′>G″ with the modulus being frequency dependent and the magnitude of G′ two-fold higher than G″ implying a weak gel state. Weak gel states are in general noted at high temperatures in most of the polymer systems, contrary to this, in our studies weak gel state is observed at lower temperature. Further, a transition from weak gel to sol state is observed at slightly elevated temperatures. The reason for the existence of weak gel state below the lower critical solution temperature is due to the micellar entanglements of poly(N-isopropylacrylamide)-b-polystyrene with one another and whereas above the lower critical solution temperature disentanglement of the micelles makes the system behave like a viscoelastic liquid. © BME-PT.'\n",
      " 'Field electron emission enhancement in lithium implanted and annealed nitrogen-incorporated nanocrystalline diamond filmsThe field electron emission (FEE) properties of nitrogen-incorporated nanocrystalline diamond films were enhanced due to Li-ion implantation/annealing processes. Li-ion implantation mainly induced the formation of electron trap centers inside diamond grains, whereas post-annealing healed the defects and converted the a-C phase into nanographite, forming conduction channels for effective transport of electrons. This resulted in a high electrical conductivity of 11.0 S/cm and enhanced FEE performance with a low turn-on field of 10.6 V/μm, a high current density of 25.5 mA/cm2 (at 23.2 V/μm), and a high lifetime stability of 1,090 min for nitrogen incorporated nanocrystalline diamond films. © 2017 Author(s).'\n",
      " 'Enhancing the oxygen ionic conductivity of (111) oriented Ce0.80Sm0.20O2-δ thin film through strain engineeringSeveral physicochemical properties can be tailored by tuning the lattice strain of the crystal. Here, we report the effect of lattice strain on oxygen ion conduction of oriented samarium doped ceria (SDC) films deposited over an amorphous quartz substrate. Lattice distortion was induced by varying the deposition rate in electron beam deposition technique (EB-PVD). Texture coefficient calculation and pole figure analysis confirms the (111) orientation in out‐off plane direction. Stress state was monitored using sin2Ψ method in tri-axial direction and the results indicate a reduction in compressive stress with an increase in deposition rate. A difference in the mean free path of adatom influences the surface morphology of SDC films with compressive stress leading to a significant impact on conductivity. Compared to higher compressive stress, thin film containing lower stress along (111) orientation exhibited a two order enhancement in conductivity. The faster ionic conductivity arises from the ease of oxygen ion hopping through the expanded lattice as compared to the highly-stressed crystal structure. Thus, the deposition rate in EB-PVD provides a valuable technique for engineering the strain to realize the potential enhancement in the efficiency of electrolyte for ITSOFC application. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd'\n",

We report here FCC-HCP coexistence to be stable in dense PNIPAM microgel crystals (Ï• andgt; 0.74) with particles in their deswollen state (referred to as osmotically compressed microgel crystals) and the FCC structure with particles in their swollen state by performing annealing studies with different cooling rates. The structure of PNIPAM microgel crystals is characterized using static light scattering technique and UV-Visible spectroscopy and dynamics by dynamic light scattering (DLS). DLS studies reveal that the particle motion is diffusive at short times in crystals with Ï• andlt; 0.74 and sub-diffusive at short times in PNIPAM crystals with Ï• andgt; 0.74. The observed sub-diffusive behavior at short times is due to the overlap (interpenetration) of the dangling polymer chains between the shells of neighbouring PNIPAM microgel particles. Overlap is found to disappear upon heating the crystals well above their melting temperature, Tm due to reduction in the particle size. Annealing studies confirm that the overlap of dangling polymer chains between the shells of neighbouring PNIPAM spheres is responsible for the stability of FCC-HCP coexistence observed in osmotically compressed PNIPAM microgel crystals. Results are discussed in the light of recent reports of stabilizing the HCP structure in hard sphere crystals by adding interacting polymer chains. © 2017 Author(s).'\n",

The formulation can be used to study the magnetoresistance and spin current too. The formulation is used to study the STT in model tunnel junctions exhibiting multiple layers and quasiparticle bands. The many body interaction that gives rise to quasiparticle bands is assumed to be a s − f exchange interaction at the electrode regions of the MTJ. The quasiparticle bands are obtained using a many body procedure and the single particle band structure is obtained using the tight binding model. The bias dependence of the STT as well as the influence of band occupancy and s − f exchange coupling strength on the STT are studied. We find from our studies that the band occupancy plays a significant role in deciding the STT and the s − f interaction strength too influences the STT significantly. Anomalous behavior in both the parallel and perpendicular components of the STT is obtained from our studies.

Using Cole-Cole fit to the permittivity data, the relaxation time τ and the dielectric strength ∆ε were estimated. Temperature variation of τ(T) in the Arrhenius representation is found to be nonlinear (non-Debyean relaxation), with increasing barrier-activation energy over successive temperature-windows. Interestingly, for all the compositions, we witness a jump in τ(T) about the ferroelectric transition temperature, concurred by a broad-maximum in ∆ε(T),signifying the critical slow down of relaxations near long-range FE-correlations. © 2017 The American Ceramic Society'\n",

However, poor dispersibility of MoS2 in the lube oils has been a great challenge. Herein, a facile and scalable hydrothermal approach is presented to synthesize the MoS2 nanosheets and then chemically functionalized with octadecanethiol (ODT). The structural defects and vacant sulfur sites on the Mo-atoms of MoS2 nanosheets are targeted for grafting of ODT via Mo-S dative linkage. The chemical and structural features of MoS2-ODT are characterized by FTIR, XPS, XRD and HRTEM analyses. The dispersion stability of MoS2-ODT nanosheets in the polyol ester lube oil is examined by UV–Visible spectroscopy. The van der Waals interaction between the octadecyl chain of MoS2-ODT and oleate chains of polyol ester lube oil facilitates the dispersion of MoS2-ODT nanosheets. Tribological results revealed that minute dosing (0.05\\xa0mg.mL−1) of thoroughly dispersed MoS2-ODT nanosheets, as an additive to polyol lube oil, significantly reduced the friction and the wear of steel tribo-pair. The uninterrupted supply of MoS2-ODT nanosheets on the tribo-contacts, formation of MoS2 thin film on tribo-interfaces, ease of shearing driven by weak van der Waals interaction between MoS2 lamellae and high mechanical strength of MoS2, collectively enhanced the tribo-performance, when thoroughly dispersed MoS2-ODT was used as an additive to the polyol lube base oil. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.'\n",

      " 'Optical properties of AlGaN nanowires synthesized via ion beam techniquesAlGaN plays a vital role in hetero-structure high electron mobility transistors by employing a two-dimensional electron gas as an electron blocking layer in multi-quantum well light emitting diodes. Nevertheless, the incorporation of Al into GaN for the formation of the AlGaN alloy is limited by the diffusion barrier formed by instant nitridation of Al adatoms by reactive atomic N. The incorporation of Al above the miscibility limit, however, can be achieved by the ion beam technique. The well known ion beam mixing (IBM) technique was carried out with the help of Ar+ irradiation for different fluences. A novel approach was also adopted for the synthesis of AlGaN by the process of post-irradiation diffusion (PID) as a comparative study with the IBM technique. The optical investigations of AlGaN nanowires, synthesized via two different methods of ion beam processing, are reported. The effect of irradiation fluence and post-irradiation annealing temperature on the random alloy formation was studied by the vibrational and photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopic studies. Vibrational studies show one-mode phonon behavior corresponding to the longitudinal optical (LO) mode of A1 symmetry [A1(LO)] for the wurtzite phase of AlGaN nanowires in the random alloy model. A maximum Al atomic percentage of ∼6.3%-6.7% was calculated with the help of band bowing formalism from the Raman spectral analysis for samples synthesized in IBM and PID processes.

      " 'The role of 1-D finite size Heisenberg chains in increasing the metal to insulator transition temperature in hole rich VO2VO2 samples are grown with different oxygen concentrations leading to different monoclinic, M1, and triclinic, T, insulating phases which undergo a first order metal to insulator transition (MIT) followed by a structural phase transition (SPT) to the rutile tetragonal phase. The metal insulator transition temperature (Tc) was found to be increased with increasing native defects. Vanadium vacancy (VV) is envisaged to create local strains in the lattice which prevents twisting of the V-V dimers promoting metastable monoclinic, M2 and T phases at intermediate temperatures. It is argued that MIT is driven by strong electronic correlation. The low temperature insulating phase can be considered as a collection of one-dimensional (1-D) half-filled bands, which undergo a Mott transition to 1-D infinitely long Heisenberg spin - chains leading to structural distortion due to spin-phonon coupling. The presence of VV creates localized holes (d0) in the nearest neighbor, thereby fragmenting the spin - chains at the nanoscale, which in turn increases the Tc value more than that of an infinitely long one. The Tc value scales inversely with the average size of the fragmented Heisenberg spin - chains following a critical exponent of -which is exactly the same as predicted theoretically for the Heisenberg spin - chain at the nanoscale undergoing SPT (spin-Peierls transition). Thus, the observation of MIT and SPT at the same time in VO2 can be explained from our phenomenological model of reduced 1-D Heisenberg spin - chains. The reported increase (decrease) in the Tc value of VO2 by doping with metals having valency less (more) than four can also be understood easily with our unified model, for the first time, considering finite size scaling of Heisenberg chains. © 2017 The Royal Society of Chemistry.'\n",

Formation of the ZnONP-GS was monitored by UV-visible spectroscopy followed by characterization and confirmation by energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and X-ray diffraction (XRD). Both the ZnONP-GS and the commercially available ZnONP-S (Sigma-Aldrich) and cationic Zn2+ from Zn(CH3COO)2 were tested in a dose range of 0–100 mg ·L–1 for their potency (i) to induce oxidative stress as measured by the generation reactive oxygen species (ROS: O2 •–, H2O2 and•OH), cell death, and lipid peroxidation; (ii) to modulate the activities of antioxidant enzymes: catalase (CAT), superoxide dismutase (SOD), guaiacol peroxidase (GPX), and ascorbate peroxidase (APX); and (iii) to cause DNA damage as determined by Comet assay in Lathyrus sativus L. root bioassay system. Antioxidants such as Tiron and dimethylthiourea significantly attenuated the ZnONP-induced oxidative and DNA damage, suggesting the involvement of ROS therein.

X-ray diffraction pattern of prepared nanoparticles confirmed that all the BSmT compositions were of the single phase orthorhombic structure with the space group of B2ab. The dielectric loss at 100\\xa0Hz varied from 0.0925 to 0.056 with an increase in Samarium content. Dielectric loss confirmed the lower leakage current of BSmT nanoparticles. The ferroelectric behavior of BSmT nanoparticles showed that the Bi3.50Sm0.50Ti3O12 had good ferroelectric property and also had minimum leakage current. The increase of coercive field (Ec) and the increase of remnant polarizations (Pr) were pronounced with the increase in Sm content confirming to the fact that the substitution of Sm3+ had improved the ferroelectric properties of BT. © 2016, The Indian Institute of Metals - IIM.'\n",
      " 'Noninvasive Determination of HV Interval Using MagnetocardiographyBackground: The His-ventricular (HV) interval is an important index of atrioventricular conduction, but at present can be reliably measured only during an invasive electrophysiology (EP) study. Magnetocardiography (MCG) is a noninvasive measurement of weak magnetic fields generated by the heart. We compared HV interval noninvasively assessed using MCG with the corresponding values measured directly in an EP study. Methods: MCG was measured using a 37-channel system inside a magnetically shielded room in patients who had previously undergone an EP study. His-bundle potential was identified in the PR segment after signal averaging. Magnetic field maps representing the spatial distribution of ramp-like signals in the PR segment generated at various instants of time were used to identify His-bundle signals in cases where the deflection representing the His was ambiguous. Results: The study included 23 patients (14 male, nine female) with a wide range of HV intervals measured during EP study (49 ± 17 ms, range 35–120 ms). In 21 (91%) subjects, discernible His-bundle signals are observed in the PR segment of MCG traces. HV intervals measured between the two methods showed a correlation (r2 = 0.87, P andlt; 0.0001) with a mean difference of 5.4 ± 3.2 ms. Conclusion: With the use of new criteria to identify the His-bundle deflection in signal-averaged MCG signals, we report a high success rate in noninvasive HV interval measurement and a good agreement with those from EP study. The results encourage the use of MCG as a noninvasive method for measurement of the HV interval. © 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.'\n",
      " 'Strain and particle size analysis in ion beam synthesized SiC nanoparticles using Raman scattering studiesWe study the strain and particle size analysis of ion beam synthesized SiC nanoparticles (NPs) embedded in Si matrix using Raman and low-frequency Raman scattering (LFRS). 300\\xa0keV C+ ions with the fluence of 2 × 1017 ions/cm2 were implanted on Si substrate at three different substrate temperatures (300, 500 and 650\\xa0°C). Raman scattering analyses confirm the formation of 3C-SiC NPs in Si matrix. Relative strain in 3C-SiC NPs estimated from Raman scattering was found to be decreases with increase of substrate temperature. The particle size distribution of 3C-SiC NPs was estimated from the signature of localized acoustic phonon modes observed in the low frequency region (ωandlt;40cm-1) of LFRS spectra. The estimated particle size of the SiC is found to be in good agreement with the TEM analysis. © 2017 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH and Co. KGaA, Weinheim'\n",
      " 'Common Methodology for Cardiac and Ocular Artifact Suppression from EEG Recordings by Combining Ensemble Empirical Mode Decomposition with Regression ApproachElectroencephalography (EEG) is a non-invasive way of recording brain activities, making it useful for diagnosing various neurological disorders. However, artifact signals associated with eye blinks or the heart spread across the scalp, contaminating EEG recordings and making EEG data analysis difficult. To solve this problem, we implement a common methodology to suppress both cardiac and ocular artifact signal, by correlating the measured contaminated EEG signals with the clean reference electro-oculography (EOG) and electrocardiography (EKG) data and subtracting the scaled EOG and EKG from the contaminated EEG recording. In the proposed methodology, the clean EOG and EKG signals are extracted by subjecting the raw reference time-series data to ensemble empirical mode decomposition to obtain the intrinsic mode functions. Then, an unsupervised technique is used to capture the artifact components. We compare the distortion introduced into the brain signal after artifact suppression using the proposed method with those obtained using conventional regression alone and with a wavelet-based approach. The results show that the proposed method outperforms the other techniques, with an additional advantage of being a common methodology for the suppression of two types of artifact. © 2017, Taiwanese Society of Biomedical Engineering.'\n",
      " 'Effective Extraction of Visual Event-Related Pattern by Combining Template Matching With Ensemble Empirical Mode DecompositionIn the field of signal processing, it is always a major challenge to extract event-based weak or low signal in the presence of high background noise. Conventionally, this is achieved by trigger-based averaging, which suppresses uncorrelated background noise and unmasks the event related pattern. In some of the previouspapers, extraction of weak event related pattern is also achieved by decomposing the signal into a set of predefined basis functions, such as wavelets. We present here, a novel approach by combining template matching with the ensemble empirical mode decomposition (EEMD). The EEMD technique is applied to decompose the noisy data corresponding to single-trial event related potentials into the so-called intrinsic mode functions (IMFs). These functions are of the same length and in the same time domain as the original signal. Therefore, the EEMD technique preserves varying frequency content along the time axis. The effective extraction of the event-related pattern proposed in this paper relies on the elimination of IMFs, which capture the features corresponding to artifacts and brain signals, based on cross-correlation with a suitable template extracted from the evoked potential obtained by the conventional unrestricted averaging across a large number of trials. We illustrate the method and compare it with conventionally used single channel wavelet-based approach for denoising visual evoked potentials during the measurement of visual evoked electroencephalogram response. © 2017 IEEE.'\n",

      " 'Supercapacitive vertical graphene nanosheets in aqueous electrolytesVertical graphene nanosheets (VGN) is a potential material for high-performance supercapacitors due to its high surface area, open interconnected network and excellent electrical conductivity. Selection of proper aqueous electrolyte is crucial for its utilization as supercapacitor electrode. The present study reports supercapacitive performance of vertical graphene nanosheets in neutral (Na2SO4), alkaline (KOH), and acidic (H2SO4) aqueous electrolytes. Factors like ionic mobility and electrolyte wettability are found to influence supercapacitor performance. The highest capacitance observed for VGN in KOH (197 μF/cm2) is attributed to the higher wettability, whereas VGN /H2SO4 system with specific areal capacitance of 188 μF/cm2 is found to have highest capacitance retention (96.8%), shortest relaxation time (50 ms), low charge transfer resistance (72 Ω\\xa0cm2) and minimal change in graphitic structure.

      " 'Microstructure and Magnetic Properties of Sn1 -xNixO2 Thin Films Prepared by Flash Evaporation TechniqueAn effort was made to develop semiconductor oxide-based room temperature dilute magnetic semiconductor (DMS) thin films based on wide band gap and transparent host lattice with transition metal substitution. The Sn1 − xNixO2 (x=0.00,0.03,0.05,0.07,0.10,and0.15) thin film samples were prepared on glass substrates by flash evaporation technique. All the samples were shown single phase crystalline rutile structure of host SnO2 with dominant (110) orientation. The Ni substitution promotes reduction of average crystallite size in SnO2 as evidenced from the reduction of crystallite size from 40 (SnO2) to 20 nm (Sn0.85Ni0.15O2). In the energy dispersive spectra as well as X-ray photoelectron spectra of all the samples show, the chemical compositions are close to stoichiometric with noticeable oxygen deficiency. The crystalline films were formed by coalescence of oval-shaped polycrystalline particles of 100 nm size as evidenced from the electron micrographs. The energy band gap of DMS films decreases from 4 (SnO2) to 3.8 eV (x= 0.05) with increase of Ni content. The magnetic hysteresis loops of all the samples at room temperature show soft ferromagnetic nature except for SnO2 film. The SnO2 films show diamagnetic nature and it converts into ferromagnetic upon substitution of 3 % Sn4 + by Ni2 +. The robust intrinsic ferromagnetism (saturation magnetization, 21 emu/cm3). Further increase of Ni content weakens ferromagnetic strength due to Ni-O antiferromagnetic interactions among the nearest neighbour Ni ions via O2 − ions.

      " \"The role of substrate bias and nitrogen doping on the structural evolution and local elastic modulus of diamond-like carbon filmsDiamond-like carbon (DLC) films are synthesized on Si using plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition. The role of substrate bias and nitrogen doping on the structural evolution and local elastic modulus of DLC films are systematically investigated. Raman spectroscopic studies reveal that the amount of graphitic C = C sp2 bonding increases with substrate bias and nitrogen doping. The density and hydrogen concentration in the films are found to vary from 0.7 to 2.2 g cm-3 and 16 to 38 atomic %, respectively, depending upon the substrate bias and nitrogen concentration in the DLC films. Atomic force acoustic microscopy (AFAM) analysis shows a direct correlation between the local elastic modulus and the structural properties estimated by Raman spectroscopy, Rutherford back scattering and elastic recoil detection analysis. AFAM analysis further confirms the evolution of soft second phases at high substrate biases ( ≥-150 V) in undoped DLC films. Further, N doping leads to the formation of such soft second phases in DLC films even at a lower substrate bias of -100 V. The AFAM studies provide direct microscopic evidence for the 'sub-implantation growth model', which predicts the formation of graphitic second phases in the DLC matrix at high substrate biases. © 2017 IOP Publishing Ltd.\"\n",
      " 'Role of oxygen functional groups in reduced graphene oxide for lubricationFunctionalized and fully characterized graphene-based lubricant additives are potential 2D materials for energy-efficient tribological applications in machine elements, especially at macroscopic contacts. Two different reduced graphene oxide (rGO) derivatives, terminated by hydroxyl and epoxy-hydroxyl groups, were prepared and blended with two different molecular weights of polyethylene glycol (PEG) for tribological investigation. Epoxy-hydroxyl-terminated rGO dispersed in PEG showed significantly smaller values of the friction coefficient. In this condition, PEG chains intercalate between the functionalized graphene sheets, and shear can take place between the PEG and rGO sheets. However, the friction coefficient was unaffected when hydroxyl-terminated rGO was coupled with PEG. This can be explained by the strong coupling between graphene sheets through hydroxyl units, causing the interaction of PEG with the rGO to be non-effective for lubrication. On the other hand, antiwear properties of hydroxyl-terminated rGO were significantly enhanced compared to epoxy-hydroxyl functionalized rGO due to the integrity of graphene sheet clusters. © 2017 The Author(s).'\n",

The pristine sample shows a metallic trend from 300 to 180 K, and an insulating behavior for T andlt; 180 K, whereas the annealed sample exhibits an insulating nature in the entire 4.2-300 K temperature range. Magnetoresistance (MR) of pristine and annealed samples reveals contrasting behaviour as a function of temperature (T) and magnetic field (B). At 4.2 K, the pristine sample shows weak antilocalization (WAL) behavior at low fields and transforms to weak localization (WL) behavior (negative MR) for B andgt; 2.5 T. Further, the quantum MR behaviours seen at low temperature gradually transform to classical B 2 dependent upon increasing the temperatures. In contrast, the annealed sample shows a WAL at small field superimposed on a parabolic feature for B andgt; ± 4 T at low temperatures (T andlt; 20 K). It shows a linear MR at intermediate temperatures (40 K andlt; T andlt; 100 K) and a parabolic MR at temperatures T andgt; 100 K. Hall measurements on both samples exhibit a nonlinear behavior at 4.2 K pointing to the existence of two types of carriers with different mobility. The annealed sample also shows a drastic decrease in mobility by one order of magnitude and a reduction in Ioffe-Regel parameter (k F l) by a factor of ∼3. Disorder-induced localization of bulk carriers and its coexistence with localization-immune surface carriers at low T leads to WAL and WL. MR observed in the annealed sample can be attributed to the presence of both quantum-classical contribution and has been analysed using the Hikami-Larkin-Nagaoka (HLN) equation. © 2017 IOP Publishing Ltd.'\n",

The influence of Pb content on thermal and local atomic structure and its qualitative consequences on the electronic properties has been elucidated. The composition dependent variation of glass transition temperature (Tg), change in specific heat capacity at the glass transition (ΔCp) and non-reversing enthalpy change (ΔHNR) complement with each other for enabling the role of Pb content on structural relaxation behavior of these glasses. The Raman spectroscopic studies reveal the presence of different structural species and its variation with Pb content, i.e. pronounced decrease in the amount of ethane-like structural units with the incorporation of Pb content. The addition of Pb content into Ge42Se58 glass, the network connectivity becomes loosened due to the depolymerization. The observed Raman band position of ethane-like structural units show noticeable blue shift with an increase of Pb content, which dictates the development of stress in the network structure caused by the predominant ionic character. The microstructural studies by positron annihilation life-time spectroscopy reveal the nature of defect states and its variation with Pb content. The composition dependent dc conductivity and its activation energy shows marked change across the p-n transition threshold due to the change in the charged defect concentration.

Results of low energy positron beam-based Doppler broadening studies imply the occurrence of vacancy kind of defects in the liquid Na-exposed SS-316. Correlating these results, the partial occurrence of FM-ordered zones in the liquid Na-exposed SS-316 is understood to be due to open volume defects, predominantly that of Ni vacancies occurring at the surface and upto a certain depth of liquid Na-exposed stainless steel.

      " 'Theoretical study of high-pressure phase stability of NaZr2(PO4)3 via elastic constants and equation of statePhase stability of NaZr2(PO4)3 has been studied through density functional theory calculations of elastic constants, equation of state and enthalpies. The changes in elastic constants as a function of pressure show that the ambient rhombohedral (R3 ¯ c) NaZr2(PO4)3 becomes unstable above 8\\xa0GPa and this instability is driven by a softening of C44 elastic constant through one of the Born stability criteria. High-pressure equation-of-state and enthalpy calculations further show that the ambient rhombohedral (R3 ¯ c) structure transforms first into another rhombohedral (R3) phase and subsequently to LiZr2(PO4)3-type orthorhombic phase at pressures above 6 and 8\\xa0GPa respectively which are in agreement with a recent x-ray diffraction study. Analysis of interatomic distances show that LiZr2(PO4)3-type orthorhombic structure allows for shorter Na–O and Zr–P bonds at high pressures which appears to enable strong bonding and stability. Calculated formation enthalpy and bulk modulus of the ambient phase of NaZr2(PO4)3 are found to be in reasonable agreement with the respective experimental values. © 2016, Indian Association for the Cultivation of Science.'\n",
      " 'Far field photoluminescence imaging of single AlGaN nanowire in the sub-wavelength scale using confinement of polarized lightTill now the nanoscale focusing and imaging in the sub-diffraction limit is achieved mainly with the help of plasmonic field enhancement by confining the light assisted with noble metal nanostructures. Using far field imaging technique, we have recorded polarized spectroscopic photoluminescence (PL) imaging of a single AlGaN nanowire (NW) of diameter ∼100 nm using confinement of polarized light. It is found that the PL from a single NW is influenced by the proximity to other NWs. The PL intensity is proportional to 1/(l×d), where l and d are the average NW length and separation between the NWs, respectively. We suggest that the proximity induced PL intensity enhancement can be understood by assuming the existence of reasonably long lived photons in the intervening space between the NWs. A nonzero non-equilibrium population of such photons may cause stimulated emission leading to the enhancement of PL emission with the intensity proportional to 1/(l×d). The enhancement of PL emission facilitates far field spectroscopic imaging of a single semiconductor AlGaN NW of sub-wavelength dimension. (Figure presented.). © 2016 by WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH and Co.

      " 'Effects of Dy sub lattice dilution on transport and magnetic properties in Dy1-xKxMnO3Interaction of multiple oxidation states of manganese ions with rare earth ions in manganites leads to the observation of various magnetic ground states. To understand the effect of average ionic size on electrical conductivity and magnetic ground state properties in Dy1-xKxMnO3 (x=0.0, 0.1, 0.2 andamp; 0.3), we have investigated electron transport as a function of temperature and magnetic properties as a function of temperature, frequency and magnetic field of these compounds. Although mixed valent manganese ions can facilitate a double exchange interaction via oxygen ion leading to a ferromagnetic metallic ground state, no insulator-metal transition was detected. On the other hand, in the compounds with x=0.0 to 0.2, transport properties suggested an adiabatic small polaron hopping conduction mechanism. However, x=0.3 compound followed a variable range hopping conduction. Temperature variation of magnetization data exhibited three different types of transitions involving Mn and Dy ions. The bifurcation between zero field cooled and field cooled magnetization data was observed in all the compounds. Field-dependent magnetization of all the compounds showed hysteresis loops for temperatures less than 10 K. Although large irreversibility between zero field cooled and field cooled magnetization data was observed with a peak for x=0.3, the peak temperatures did not alter with frequency ruling out the possibility of spin glass behavior. The presence of hysteresis loops and lack of saturation magnetization implied the simultaneous presence of ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic exchange interactions well within the antiferromagnetic ordering of Mn ions. © 2017 Author(s).'\n",

Refinement of powder X-ray diffraction data showed that both materials exhibit orthorhombic structure with Pnma space group. Although Bismuth substitution retains the crystal structure, bond angles and bond lengths within MnO6 octahedra are altered as compared to the pristine compound, DyMnO3. While bond angle between manganese ions along the b-axis reduces slightly (1°), axial bond angle increased by\\xa0∼3° in the substituted compound. Raman bands arising from the atomic vibrations of rare earth dysprosium and oxygen ions have been identified from room temperature Raman spectra. For 10\\xa0at.% substitution of Bi3+, these modes are hardened. Transport measurement studies indicated that the materials are semiconducting in nature with small polaron hopping type of conduction.

Temperature and frequency variation of ac susceptibility data corroborated the dc magnetization results. In both compounds, magnetization versus applied magnetic field curves measured at several temperatures from room temperature down to 10\\xa0K showed linear behavior revealing paramagnetic nature.

Their formation energies lie within a band of 166 meV/atom, so they can be formed together in any optimal high temperature synthesis of B12C3 and they are thermodynamically stable at temperatures up to 660\\xa0K. This work is the first independent confirmation using structure search that B11Cp(CBC) is the ground state structure of B12C3 stoichiometry. New structures like the 14-atom-cage and the supercell (B11Cp)(B10Cpe 2)(CBC)(CBB) have also emerged in the structure search. Five structures have base-centered monoclinic symmetry and the supercell has triclinic symmetry, implying that the determination of monoclinic symmetry in B12C3 by experimental measurements is an option for further inquiry. The mechanical stability of these systems are established through the analysis of their elastic constants and their dynamical stability from the phonon data. The high value of Bulk modulus (∼250\\xa0GPa) indicates their high hardness and the B/G value confirms their brittle nature. The electronic structure shows that they are semiconductors with a significant reduction in the band gap when the structure does not contain the CBC chain. The curve fitting of the cumulative IR spectrum against the experimental spectrum implies that the presence of B11Cp(CBC) in the ground state composition could mostly be through structures of larger unit cells. The hardness values of these systems estimated by using the semi-empirical model based on bond strength are in excellent agreement with the experimental values.

The magnetic studies at room temperature reveal the ferromagnetic nature of ITO and the strength of magnetization is superior to those of In2O3 and SnO2. However, the magnetic studies at 100 K revealed reduced ferromagnetism, which could be attributed to reduced itinerary electrons at low temperature.

Spin flip arises in the context of separability, quantification of entanglement and the construction of universal NOT gates. The present work investigates the relationship between the quantum state of a multiqubit system represented by the discrete Wigner function (DWFs) and its spin-flipped counterpart. The two are shown to be related through a Hadamard matrix that is independent of the choice of the quantum net used for the tomographic reconstruction of the DWF.

      " 'Charged vacancy induced enhanced piezoelectric response of reactive assistive IBSD grown AlN thin filmsPiezoelectric response of AlN thin films was investigated in a AlN/Ti/Si(1 0 0) layer structure prepared by ion beam sputter deposition (IBSD) in reactive assistance of N+/ ions. The samples were characterized for their microstructure, piezoelectric response and charged defects using high resolution x-ray diffraction (HR-XRD), piezo force microscopy (PFM) and photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy respectively. Our results show that the films are highly textured along the a-axis and charged native point defects are present in the microstructure. Phase images of these samples obtained from PFM show that the films are predominantly N-polar. The measured values of piezoelectric coefficient d 33(eff) for these samples are as high as 206 ± 20 pm V-1 and 668 ± 60 pm V-1 calculated by piezo response loop for AlN films of a thickness of 235 nm and 294 nm respectively. A mechanism for high d 33(eff) values is proposed with a suitable model based on the charged defects induced enhanced polarization in the dielectric continuum of AlN. © 2016 IOP Publishing Ltd.'\n",
      " 'High pressure structural phase transitions in Ho: Eu2O3Structural stability and phase transitions in mixed rare earth sesquioxides (Eu1−xHox)2O3 crystallizing in the cubic bixbyite structure were investigated under high pressure using angle dispersive X-ray diffraction technique. Studies on various compositions of the mixed oxide show that when the average cationic radius, RRE (where, RRE = xRHo+(1−x)REu) is equivalent to or below 0.9164 Å, the system undergoes a cubic to monoclinic transition as a function of pressure, whereas, when RRE equivalent to or above 0.9220 Å it is observed to prefer a transition from cubic to hexagonal structure. Based on our detailed investigations, a pressure-concentration (P−x) phase diagram for (Eu1−xHox)2O3 up to a pressure of 15 GPa is constructed. The bulk moduli for the parent and high pressure phases are calculated from the Birch-Murnaghan equation of state fit to the experimental pressure volume data and are reported. Structural analysis based on refinement has revealed that, an increasing structural rigidity of the cubic phase with decreasing RRE leads to an increase in the transition pressure and bulk moduli except for 0.4 ≤ x ≤ 0.6. The observed significant reduction in bulk moduli and transition pressure for 0.4 ≤ x ≤ 0.6 is due to the increased micro strain/internal pressure developed upon doping. © 2017'\n",

This role has further been explored by the introduction of graphene into TiO2 matrix. TiO2/reduced graphene oxide (TiO2/RGO) or TiO2/graphene (TiO2/GR) has shown its prospects or relevance to be considered as the next generation photocatalyst for hydrogen production by its reported values in terms of producing hydrogen gas. Hence, there is a requirement of having a detailed up to date write up on the work done in this area in terms of its synthetic procedures, properties and its effect on hydrogen production. Herein, we discuss the different methods involved in the synthesis of such highly efficient materials followed by a brief explanation on its structural and morphological properties. Furthermore, a comparative study on the recent developments in terms of hydrogen evolution efficiency along with a mechanistic approach is also described. Finally, the current challenge and possibility of the future development in this direction is emphasized. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd'\n",

      " 'Tribo-mechanical properties of reactive magnetron sputtered transition metal carbide coatingsHard and wear resistant coatings are useful to enhance the functional properties and improve the lifetime of mechanical components. This study proposes a relationship between microstructure and tribo-mechanical properties of TiC, CrC, ZrC and WC transition metal carbide coatings. In these coatings, an amorphous carbon (a-C) matrix phase coexists with a crystalline TMC phase. Superior wear resistance of ZrC coatings followed by the TiC coating was observed and this was explained by improved crystallinity and a-C phase present in coatings. Wear mechanisms were proposed by chemical analysis of wear tracks using micro Raman spectroscopy and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy. © 2017'\n",
      " 'Experimental and numerical investigations on plasma sprayed ceramic coatings with varying coating thicknessCoatings are extensively used in many tribological applications in order to reduce the wear rate. Despite its advantages, life of the coatings has been limited by the stresses arising at the interfacial region. The purpose of this work is to study three different types of ceramic coatings grown by plasma spraying method on titanium substrate by ball indentation and finite element method (FEM). Micrometer-sized powders of the following compositions were plasma sprayed on to the Ti6Al4V (TAV) substrate (flat plate): 1) Al2O3 (AO); 2) 8 mol% yttrium stabilised zirconia (8YSZ); 3) Al2O3-40 wt% 8YSZ (A4Z). The effect of type of material and coating thickness on stress distribution and contact pressure has been investigated. The dimensionless parameters which aid in the comparison of the behaviour of the elastically coated sphere and coating thickness with different material properties were identified and used for further investigation. The investigation has revealed that Al2O3-40 wt% 8YSZ coating on titanium substrate is the most desirable one for protecting the substrate against yielding and hence it could be used as a protective layer.

      " 'Band alignment and charge transfer pathway in three phase anatase-rutile-brookite TiO2 nanotubes: An efficient photocatalyst for water splittingThe study reports electrochemical synthesis, phase evolution and hydrogen generation efficiency of anatase, anatase-rutile and anatase-rutile-brookite (ARB) TiO2 nanotubes for the first time. The SEM and TEM micrographs confirm the tubular morphology of the samples. The presence of anatase, rutile and brookite phases in a single nanotube is confirmed from high resolution TEM analysis. The water splitting efficiency of the three systems are studied under one sun illumination. It is observed that the anatase-rutile-brookite TiO2 nanotubes are highly efficient compared to anatase-rutile or anatase TiO2 nanotubes. The hydrogen generated by ARB composites, after four hours of one sun illumination, is found to be nearly twice that of anatase TiO2 nanotubes and 1.6 times that of anatase-rutile TiO2 nanotubes. The results suggest that the ARB in single nanotube having two junction interfaces, highly facilitate inter-particle charge transfer compared to single junction anatase-rutile or bare anatase TiO2 nanotubes. From the deconvolution of PL spectra and the synchrotron radiation assisted valence band edge analysis, the band diagram for the anatase-rutile-brookite phase is constructed. The charge separation and its transfer pathway for efficient photo-assisted water splitting are delineated. This opens a new route for the simple synthesis and study of tri-phase TiO2 for efficient photocatalytic water splitting compared to the widely studied two phase TiO2. © 2017'\n",

Thermal behavior of the polymeric intermediate of LiMgBO3 sample was studied by TG-DTA. Structure and the local structural coordination of the as-prepared and calcined polymeric intermediate at 750 °C of LiMgBO3 sample were investigated by FT-IR and 7Li andamp; 11B magic angle spinning - nuclear magnetic resonance (MAS-NMR) measurements respectively. XRD results confirm the formation of the pure nanocrystalline monoclinic phase of the LiMgBO3 sample prepared at 750 °C. The BET surface area of the calcined polymeric intermediate of LiMgBO3 sample is found to be 60.48 m2g-1. The observed SEM micrographs of the LiMgBO3 sample showed the formation of agglomerated sheet-like morphology particles and the existence of Mg and O elements in LiMgBO3 are confirmed from the SEM-EDX spectral result. The band gap energy of LiMgBO3 sample is evaluated and it was found to be 3.64 eV. From the analysis of the measured impedance data, at different frequencies and temperatures, the evaluated electrical conductivity of LiMgBO3 sample was found to be 9.706 × 10−5 S cm−1 at 200 °C. From the temperature dependence of conductivity (log σT vs. 1000/T) plot of the LiMgBO3 sample, the evaluated activation energy (Ea) for the migration of the charge carrier was found to be 0.62 eV.

The bundles of TiO2 NTs powder prepared via rapid breakdown anodization have a length of 5 to 6 μm and outer diameter of 20 to 25 nm. Sodium borohydride based reduction of chloroplatinic acid and palladium chloride with the TiO2 NTs powder resulted in Pt/TiO2 and Pd/TiO2 composite materials. Ni/TiO2 composite was prepared by mixing directly Ni nanoparticles (35 nm) and TiO2 NTs. The electrochemical performance of the Pt/TiO2, Pd/TiO2 and Ni/TiO2 electrodes exhibited better selectivity, sensitivity and wide linear range for the detection of the analyte H2O2, in comparison with pristine TiO2 NTs powder. Among the composites, the Ni/TiO2 electrode exhibited high electrocatalytic activity toward oxidation of H2O2 in 0.1 M NaOH solution. At an applied potential of +0.45 V vs. NCE, the Ni/TiO2 composite electrode exhibits a linear dependence (R2 = 0.997) in the H2O2 concentration up to 3365 μM with a sensitivity of 5.3 μA mM-1 and detection limit of 20 μM.

      " 'Anomalous variation of Boson peak and fragility and their correlations with intermediate-range structure in PbO-B2O3 glassesUnderstanding the microscopic origin of physical properties is fundamental to the study of glasses. In the present study, unique trends were observed in structural and dynamical properties in lead-borate [xPbO:(1-x)B2O3] glasses upon increasing the modifier. Properties driven by short-range structural changes like, glass transition temperature (Tg) and elastic modulii exhibit a broad maxima around x\\xa0=\\xa00.3, in congruence with the average coordination number andlt;randgt;. Using Raman spectroscopy, this behaviour is attributed to the gradual conversion of three-coordinate (B3) to four-coordinate (B4) boron species. However, dynamic properties like the Boson peak and fragility behave similar to the above structural properties except an anomalous dip at x\\xa0=\\xa00.3. The corresponding dynamic correlation length, therefore, exhibits a decrease except a peak at x\\xa0=\\xa00.3 with increasing x. The static correlation lengths estimated from the first sharp diffraction peak (FSDP), did not follow a linear trend with the dynamic correlation lengths, indicating a different spatial origin. The analysis of the Boson peak and FSDP suggests that while the Boson peak arises from intermediate-range ordering within the network units, the FSDP arises due to ordering of voids between such units. Moreover, the Boson peak maximum showed a linear decrease with increasing andlt;randgt;, while the Boson peak position and fragility were found to vary linearly. These correlations emerge from the evolution of the network packing and connectivity with the addition of modifier and changing role of lead oxide as a glass former at higher concentrations. The anomalous variation in dynamical properties reflects the critical role of Pb2+ in tuning the intermediate-range structure of the vitreous network. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.'\n",
      " 'Hydrostatic pressure dependence on the collapsing of heptamer clusters in the charge ordered spinel AlV2O4Charge frustrated spinels have engaged the interest of condensed matter studies due to the novel formation of multimer molecular sub units that lifts the degeneracy in the ground state. An exhaustive study on the stability of these molecular sub units is not available in the literature. In the present study, evidence has been obtained for the first time that hydrostatic pressure beyond 21 GPa, destabilizes the vanadium heptamer molecular sub units reversibly in the unique ambient temperature charge ordered spinel AlV2O4. The bulk modulus and its pressure derivative of the charge ordered phase are constrained. In addition a systematic structural analysis as a function of temperature shows destabilization of vanadium trimers those stack up to make the heptamer units. The crystal structure and total energy have been calculated using first principles density functional formalism (GGA approximation) as a function of pressure. The results obtained corroborate the stability of the frustrated phase beyond 20 GPa. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd'\n",
      " 'Temperature dependent structural, vibrational and magnetic properties of K3Gd5(PO4)6Herein we report the evolution of the crystal structure of K3Gd5(PO4)6 in the temperature range from 20 K to 1073 K, as observed from variable temperature X-ray diffraction and Raman spectroscopic studies. K3Gd5(PO4)6 has an open tunnel containing a three dimensional structure built by [Gd5(PO4)6]3- ions which in turn are formed of PO4 tetrahedra and GdOn (n = 8 and 9) polyhedra. The empty tunnels in the structure are occupied by K+ ions and maintain charge neutrality in the lattice. Evolution of unit cell parameters with temperature shows a systematic increase with temperature. The average axial thermal expansion coefficients between 20 K and 1073 K are: αa = 10.6 × 10-6 K-1, αb = 5.5 × 10-6 K-1 and αc = 16.4 × 10-6 K-1. The evolution of distortion indices of the various coordination polyhedra with temperature indicates a gradual decrease with increasing temperature, while those of Gd2O9 and K2O8 polyhedra show opposite trends. The overall anisotropy of the lattice thermal expansion is found to be controlled largely by the effect of temperature on GdOn polyhedra and their linkages. Temperature dependent Raman spectroscopic studies indicated that the intensities and wavenumbers of most of the Raman modes decrease continuously with increasing temperature. Anharmonic analyses of Raman modes indicated that the lattice, rigid translation and librational modes have larger contributions towards thermal expansion of K3Gd5(PO4)6 compared to high frequency internal modes. The temperature and field dependent magnetic measurements indicated no long range ordering down to 2 K and the observed effective magnetic moment per Gd3+ ion and the Weiss constant are 7.91 μB and 0.38 K, respectively. © the Owner Societies 2017.'\n",
      " 'Phase evolution and magnetic properties of DC sputtered Fe-Ga (Galfenol) thin films with growth temperaturesWe report on the evolution of phases, morphology and magnetic properties of DC magnetron sputtered FeGa thin films with the different growth temperatures: room temperature, 100 °C, 200 °C, and 300 °C. These films were grown on Si substrate and were analysed for their morphological, structural and magnetic properties. The X-ray diffraction analysis reveals that the films are nanocrystalline and improve their crystallinity as the growth temperature increases from room temperature to 300 °C. Scanning electron microscopy images indicate grain growth and the morphology changes from spherical to platelets with increase in substrate temperatures. The films deposited at room temperature and 100 °C show very low magnetization and coercivity. On increasing the substrate temperature to 200 °C, it is observed that the M-H curves are isotropic with the films not attaining saturation. At 300 °C, there is substantial increase in coercivity and magnetization observed due to the larger grains present in the films. Magnetic properties also depend on in-plane (463 G, 46.557 emu/cc) and out-of-plane (860 G, 42.774 emu/cc) orientations with small anisotropy. Such an increase in magnetic properties is attributed to increase in grain size and change in morphology. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.'\n",
      " 'The influence of carbon concentration on the electronic structure and magnetic properties of carbon implanted ZnO thin filmsThe influence of carbon concentration on the electronic and magnetic properties of C-implanted ZnO thin films has been studied using synchrotron radiation based X-ray absorption spectroscopic techniques and vibrating sample magnetometer measurements. 20 keV carbon ions were implanted in ZnO films with different fluences (2 × 1016, 4 × 1016 and 6 × 1016 ions per cm2). The pristine ZnO film shows diamagnetic behaviour while the C-implanted films exhibit room temperature ferromagnetism. Our first-principles calculations based on density functional theory show an appreciable magnetic moment only when the implanted C atom sits either in the O-site (2 μB) or in the interstitial position (1.88 μB), whereas the C atom in the Zn substitutional position does not possess any magnetic moment. X-ray absorption near edge structure analysis at the O K-edge reveals that the charge transfer from O-2p to the C-defect site causes the ferromagnetism in the C-implanted ZnO film at low fluence. However at high fluence, the implanted C replaces the lattice and produces more Zn vacancies, as evidenced by extended X-ray absorption fine structure studies at the Zn K-edge, which favors the ferromagnetism. The persistence of the implanted carbon and ferromagnetism of the C-implanted ZnO film has also been studied by isothermal annealing at 500 °C and discussed in detail. © 2017 the Owner Societies.'\n",
      " 'Evolution of nanostructured single-phase CoSb3 thin films by low-energy ion beam induced mixing and their thermoelectric performanceSkutterudites are emerging as potential candidates that show high efficiency and thus provide an ideal platform for research. The properties of nanostructured films of skutterudites are different from those of the corresponding bulk. The present study reports the evolution of nanostructured single-phase CoSb3 fabricated by using low-energy ion irradiation of Co/Sb bilayer films and subsequent annealing at an optimized temperature and their Seebeck coefficients (S). The effects of ion beam parameters with annealing on the phase evolution and nanostructure modifications were studied. An increase in Xe+ ion fluence resulted in complete mixing of Co/Sb on postannealing forming flower-like nanostructures of single phase CoSb3. The temperature-dependent electrical resistivity (ρ) increases with the ion fluence because of defect creation which further increases on postannealing due to surface nanostructuring. The S of these films of CoSb3 is found to be higher and this is attributed to the formation of a uniform layer of nanostructured CoSb3 alloy thin film. The S and Hall coefficients of all these films are negative implying that they are n-type semiconductors. © the Owner Societies 2017.'\n",

Body Centered Cubic (BCC) materials exhibits better thermal properties as compared to Face Centered Cubic (FCC) materials, in addition to excellent resistance to helium embrittlement and void swelling under higher dpa levels, making them the promising materials for future nuclear applications. Fracture toughness in BCC has a well defined temperature dependent transition as compared to FCC materials, which is a major concern restricting their application to high dose conditions. In the present paper such strong temperature dependence of strain rate and flow stress in BCC materials is investigated numerically for both non-irradiated and irradiated conditions. In view of dislocations mobility being a fundamental property to determine the plastic   behavior, a dislocation based material model is proposed which is based on physical approach rather than phenomenological.'\n",

      " 'Investigation of molten fuel coolant interaction phenomena using real time X-ray imaging of simulated woods metal-water system\\tIn liquid metal fast breeder reactors, postulated failures of the plant protection system may lead to serious unprotected accidental consequences. Unprotected transients are generically categorized as transient overpower accidents and transient under cooling accidents. In both cases, core meltdown may occur and this can lead to a molten fuel coolant interaction (MFCI). The understanding of MFCI phenomena is essential for study of debris coolability and characteristics during post-accident heat removal. Sodium is used as coolant in liquid metal fast breeder reactors. Viewing inside sodium at elevated temperature is impossible because of its opaqueness. In the present study, a methodology to depict MFCI phenomena using a flat panel detector based imaging system (i.e., real time radiography) is brought out using a woods metal-water experimental facility which simulates the UO2-Na interaction. The developed imaging system can capture attributes of the MFCI process like jet breakup length, jet front velocity, fragmented particle size, and a profile of the debris bed using digital image processing methods like image filtering, segmentation, and edge detection. This paper describes the MFCI process and developed imaging methodology to capture MFCI attributes which are directly related to the safe aspects of a sodium fast reactor.\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t'\n",

India-specific Reduced Activation Ferritic-Martensitic (IN-RAFM) steel is the chosen structural material for the fabrication of LLCB TBM. IN-RAFM steel plates with different thickness are being produced from commercial heats. Presently, characterization for mechanical and physical properties is in progress in order to generate material properties database from these commercial heats. In order to avoid welds on plasma facing surface of TBM First Wall (FW), scaled down mock-ups of FW are being fabricated using Hot Isostatic Pressing (HIP). Electron Beam (EB) welding, Laser/laser-hybrid welding and Narrow Gap-Tungsten Inert Gas (NG-TIG) welding, are being developed for fabrication of other TBM components. These welding processes have distinct advantage over conventional welding processes because of their high depth to width ratio, minimal HAZ, lower weld volume, reduced distortion and lower residual stresses in the weld joints. Mock-ups of LLCB TBM components are being fabricated using Grade 91/IN-RAFM steel to investigate the accessibility for the envisaged welding processes and to identify and develop the non-destructive evaluation (NDE) techniques. In addition, this would also help to establish the assembly sequence of LLCB TBM. Ultrasonic based methodologies are under development to assure integrity of these joints in the fabricated components. Details of these developments in IN-RAFM steel as structural material, fabrication technologies and mock-ups fabrication towards realization of the LLCB TBM are discussed in this paper.'\n",

For x\\u202f=\\u202f0.0 to 0.5, the compounds have orthorhombic structure and for x\\u202f=\\u202f0.8 and 1.0, the structure changed to hexagonal structure corresponding to 2H. Raman spectra of the materials compliment structural phase transition. Phonon lifetimes estimated from the Raman line width were found to be in the order of pico seconds. X-ray photoelectron spectra of Dy1-xBaxMnO3, revealed the presence of Dy, Ba, Mn and O elements with respective binding energies. Mn ions were found to be in the mixed valent states of Mn (III) and Mn (IV) and their ratio decreased with increasing Ba concentration. Temperature behavior of electrical resistivity of all the compounds showed semiconducting behavior that persisted in the entire temperature range with small polaron hopping conduction mechanism. As Ba content increased, activation energies for hopping of polarons decreased in the orthorhombic phase and increased in the hexagonal phase. Magnetic studies as a function of temperature indicated that ordering temperatures of rare earth (Dy) moments are suppressed with Ba substitution. Random occupation of magnetic Dy3+, Mn3+ and Mn4+ ions in Dy1-xBaxMnO3 system resulted in complex magnetic structures. The reduction in the experimental effective magnetic moments determined from the Curie-Weiss fit parameters followed the magnetic dilution. Isothermal magnetization curves confirmed the presence of multiple interactions between the magnetic ions.'\n",
      " \"Experimental simulation of downward molten material relocation by jet ablation of structures and fuel coolant interaction in a fast reactor In the remote chance of a core melt-down accident in a fast reactor, the molten corium from the fuel subassembly can come out in the form of a liquid jet due to the prevailing transient pressure. This high temperature jet is capable of causing local breaches on horizontal solid structures such as the grid plate with which they come into contact inside the main vessel. After penetration through the plates, the molten jet undergoes fragmentation in the bulk coolant available below the grid plate, in the lower plenum and settles on the core catcher. Experimental investigation of molten material relocation in the downward direction is carried out with a wood's metal jet impinging on a pair of solid wood's metal plates. The wood's metal alloy is heated electrically to about 300\\u202f°C inside the melt chamber and released through a nozzle to impinge on the dry plates mounted on rigid supports and allowed to pierce through the plates. The jet then gets quenched in bulk water contained in the experimental vessel. The trajectory of vertical jet impinging on the set of two parallel horizontal plates is captured using a high speed camera. Thermocouples are placed on the top and bottom surface of the plates to assess the temperature evolution. The breach area formed on the plates by the hot molten jet is assessed from the experiments. The initial pressure of the liquid jet is varied from 0\\u202fbar to 2\\u202fbar gauge pressure. The mass of the debris collected on the breached wood's metal target plates and the stainless steel collector plate gives evidence that the entire molten mass of jet does not reach the bottom collector plate but gets distributed on all the plates. The particle size distribution is obtained for the fragmented wood's metal debris settled on the collector plate. It is observed that the mass median diameter of the fragmented particles and porosity of the debris bed decreases as the jet release pressure is increased. An empirical correlation between the particle size represented by the mass median diameter and the initial pressure of the jet is obtained.\"\n"

      " 'Round robin exercise on ball indentation technique in India: Indian nuclear reactor materials This paper presents outcome of round robin exercise on usage of ball indentation technique to predict strength properties of three different materials which are used in Indian nuclear reactors. The main objectives were to evolve a standardized procedure of determining the mechanical properties by the Ball Indentation technique and quantification of the variation in strength and fracture properties due to ageing through such tests. Standard uniaxial tensile tests were also carried out to quantify the differences between strength properties predicted by ball indentation and those determined using conventional tests. Three different materials studied were, carbon-manganese steel (Grade: SA 333Gr.6), stainless steel (SA312 Type 304LN) and zirconium alloy (Zr-2.5Nb). The carbon-manganese steel and stainless steel materials were drawn from extruded pipes while Zr-2.5Nb was drawn from pressure tubes, used in Indian Pressurized Heavy Water Reactors. Ball indentation tests were carried out on materials in as received and in aged conditions. The ageing was simulated artificially. The carbon-manganese steel and stainless steels were subjected to cold work while Zr-2.5Nb alloy was subjected to heat treatment at different temperatures with varying hold times and in some cases with charged hydrogen. The round robin exercise was conducted within different research centers of Department of Atomic Energy (DAE), India. This was a blind exercise in which all the conventional tests were carried out by a group (who was not involved in Ball Indentation tests) after the completion of ball indentation tests by participants.\\r\\\\\\r\\n\\r\\\\\\r\\nThe paper presents the prediction of strength properties, using ball indentation, by different participants. The reasons of scatter in the results among the various participants and differences with respect to conventional test results are discussed in the paper.']\n"
